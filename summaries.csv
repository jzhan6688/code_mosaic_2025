Cheap paper, over large envelope, & the personal message not very nicely laid out. Not even central to the paper. I had to redo the message & print off a  version at home that was more acceptable for gifting. (I am referring to the customer&#39;s personal message you put in with the charm, not the card the charm is on, that is nice). Hope my feedback is of help for you to improve the overall appearance. I do not wish to be seen as a &#39;hater&#39; as some call negative but helpful feedback. Thanks | The perfect little something for my youngest sister. It arrived the first few days of her being a new mom.

452168602,"Amazing seller!! My first order got lost in the mail (no fault of the seller) and when I let her know she immediately offered to send a replacement at no charge. I looked for my package for another week, but once I knew it was truly lost, she sent a new one immediately and I had it in two days. That&#39;s amazing customer service!! The kit itself is well packaged with all the high quality supplies I need, so excited to get started and I&#39;ll be ordering from this shop again! | This is a very cute kit! I liked everything about it, but some parts of the instructions were confusing to me as a newbie! I would definitely recommend this kit! | Great little kit, shipped quickly and looks like something my non-crafty self will actually be able to do :-) I can&#39;t wait to do it with my coworkers for a team building event next month! | Easy to follow for a first time stitcher. Thanks! | Love this pattern! Fast shipping, great product. | Easy to follow instructions with everything I needed included. Such a fun project! | I love the colors and design of this mid century tree pattern!  Excellent instructions are included and I appreciate the larger pattern grid, makes it easier to follow.  Thank you for offering kits, it is nice to have everything included.  The 22 count Aida cloth is beautiful, much smaller than what I am used to working with, but looking forward to the challenge! My order arrived super quick and I&#39;m looking forward to starting on the project.   Thank you! | I would not recommend this to new cross stitchers, as the directions were unclear. I discovered my mistake by watching YouTube videos, after realizing that the directions I had received in the kit were not thorough. At this point it was too late to undo the stitches, so I went out and bought new string, hoop, and fabric. I&#39;m about one third done with my second try, and now see that something else must be off because it is not centered. This is has been a true test of patience and, with the combined costs of this kit and my unexpected &quot;mini kit&quot;, has been a pricey pastime! I give it two stars because I&#39;m sure it would be just fine for someone who has done this before, but I have been disappointed as a newcomer to this craft. | I probably didn‚Äôt read the description closely enough. Very tiny and hard to work. | Easy to follow pattern and very cute design | Fast shipping, cute design and high quality materials | Loved it. Easy to read instructions. Perfect for beginners. | I&#39;ve had so many ppl compliment this piece! :D | Love the mid-century designs! Instructions are clear and easy to follow. | I&#39;m posting 5 stars so I can share a picture of my finished project, although my review for this purchase is mixed. The item took a very long time to ship, and there was conflicting information about processing times. When it arrived, several of the colors had been crossed out and changed on my pattern... meaning my finished product looked a bit different from the photos (darker, less retro).\nTLDR: Takes a long time to ship, and I didn&#39;t receive the same colors pictured in the listing. Prob won&#39;t be returning.","The kits have fast shipping, a cute design, and high-quality materials, with easy-to-follow instructions, though some found the instructions unclear, especially for beginners."

Wear them instead of socks, as they fit very much like a thicker sock.\n If you have a narrow foot, these are perfect. If you have a wider foot like I do, expect a tighter fit, again, more like a sock, or order 1 size up.\nI do plan to order a few more pair but closer to summer, as I prefer a thicker, chunkier, looser fitting slipper I can wear over socks for winter. | Arrived just in time for Christmas. My daughter loves them. Thanks! | Beautifully made and so comfortable! My wife loves them. | These are adorable, well made slipper socks. But they do run small. The opening for the foot was too small for my wide feet. So, I mailed them to my daughter in TX who loved them.

1477817106,"Gives the computer a nice lift so better airflow can come through! | Perfect fit, very high quality print. | Packaging was fantastic shipping was quick, and fast to respond to my questions! | Great feet for the Ridge. Improves airflow, reduces horizontal layout footprint, looks great. \n\nI have a few minor negatives, and these aren&#39;t much:\n1. Rubber feet would be nice. I&#39;ll add my own, but a full thin adhesive rubber strip would have perfected the product. \n2. Fitting is a little awkward, because of course it can&#39;t use the Ridge&#39;s designated holes - it does fit flat, but initially I got the wrong holes a couple times and ended with them a little wonky or bowed. \n3. I feel like it may damage the panel a bit where contact is made - there&#39;s not really anything to stop that (and that is an issue with this case&#39;s finish anyway, same happens with the stock feet options). | Much better than the included stand for horizontal placement | Clean. Look solid. Added anti skid pads to the bottom | Works perfectly and looks great. The original stock side mount felt like an afterthought as it wasn&#39;t placed high enough for proper airflow. This stand solves that problem excellently.\nPlacement is also high enough I was able to mount a 140mm pressure fan to the outside of the case for additional cooling. \nFast shipping time as well. \nMy only suggestion is I think a paper printout to show what holes the mount should be screwed into on the case would be helpful as I didn&#39;t realize immediately that the stand needed to be mounted at a slight angle.\nOverall 5/5 I am looking forward to buying something from this shop again. | Really Helps Air Flow. Cpu never hit 90c after putting legs and the 40mm fan mount on | Super quality print. Looks much sleeker than the standard feet that come with the Fractak Ridge. Also raises it up higher than the standard feet and allows for more airflow. I ended up drilling holes through the GPU side panel so both the GPU and CPU exhaust out of the top and GPU intakes from the bottom. | Looks great, no wobble, and better airflow! | The stands are great! Easy to install. Highly recommend! | good seller speedy shipping, high quality stand | Great products! Thank you! | Love it great product will buy it again | fit perfectly and great quality | Great addition to my build, gives it a good look and helps with air flow over what comes with the case. | Wonderful printing quality as per usual.","The product is praised for its high-quality print, perfect fit, improved airflow, and aesthetic appeal compared to the standard feet, with fast shipping also being noted."

Tres Bon! | 4) The first courier company (Parcel Monkey?) that you chose, never delivered anything! This is your fault and not mine. I paid for what I bought. So from now on maybe you should inform your customers that since the UK is not part of the EU anymore, custom taxes will be involved. \n5) I paid more than 225$ and customs and taxes are another 193.20 euros. Would you pay it? Would anyone pay this ridiculous amount if they knew before buying any of your products?? I don&#39;t think so.... \n6) You have the nerve to tell me that I need to pay for you to receive the knobs back? Seriously?  And NO it is not my responsibility to know the shipping process. It is your responsibility to inform your customers. All I know is that I wasted 4 months and $200 for knobs that I never got.. \nYour business is terrible and I would definitely never recommen | Hello Kelly (Surface Candy), \nYou keep mentioning that I requested the knobs to be sent to Greece as if Greece is not part of the EU. So let me tell you a few things. \n1) I ordered the knobs on the 29th of April (!) to be shipped in the United States. Little did I know that it would take you 45 days to make the knobs and eventually ship them. I patiently waited.. \n2) Even if you did ship to the original address as you are frequently mentioning, the knobs would have been delivered after the 1st of July. So customs would be involved in the USA too. Laws and regulations changed on the 1st of July and it is definitely your responsibility to know about it and not mine. \n3) I asked if it would be easier for you (so that i get it faster) to ship to Greece instead. You agreed without mentioning anything about customs! | Bought these knobs to make over a little chest of drawers and they‚Äôre perfect!\nCustomer service was also excellent! | Absolutely love these! Will look great on my furniture","Buyers are happy with the knobs, noting their beauty, attention to detail, perfect fit, and suitability for furniture updates, with some praising the fast delivery and excellent customer service."

1479590877,"Waiting on the fabric for this | Love this pattern! Can‚Äôt wait to use! | Very pretty and true to size | good quality. easy to follow :) | Pattern was fairly easy but instructions were not very clear. Do not recommend for a beginner sewer. | Great experience with the seller | OK. The easiest thing to point out is the physical product in the listing images do not match up with the actual pattern. There are no images in the instructions to guide you and the reference images in the listing barely help; the language of the pattern lacks clarity as well. I may not know corsetry, but I know sewing and my two wedding dress helpers DO have corset experience and they were just as confused. This listing is for a FASHION PIECE, so do not expect structure. We are having to rework everything to increase the size, alter the back for full lacing(a zipper? really?), altering seams and boning placement slightly to hide the boning so I don&#39;t look like I&#39;m wearing undergarments. If you have only basic sewing experience, choose a different sewing pattern, &quot;this is not the pattern you are looking for.&quot; So disappointed. | Pattern was a bit wonky and I couldn&#39;t get the scale to perfectly match up with my ruler.

Thank you | Very fast shipping great product, the only thing I didnt like is the way the sage sticks burn. I'm new to sage so that does not mean that there is anything at all wrong with it. I am assuming that the last bundle of sage I bought (from another store) was possibly wrapped different or maybe even a different type of sage. The other seemed very tight and compact almost hard to get a good burn but lasted me a very long time. This one burned very easy and seemed not as tight, there were sticks poking out or up as it burned down. hard to explain.

The smell is magnificent and I can‚Äôt wait to start burning these. Shipping was alright.... Not too late but also not as quick as I‚Äôm used to with other shops.\n\nHowever, the size of the sage sticks are REALLY misleading I‚Äôd say that they are a little smaller than a soda can each, and their thickness is about two fingers wide.... It makes me question if I would be willing to dish out fifty dollars again for a product like this..... So if you are looking for sage sticks on the smaller side, this product might be for you. But transitioning from my usual 8 inch large bunch to a smaller size will definitely take some adjustment.... :( | Great company. Love their quality. | Very satisfied!

All the 1260 files came just as described actually. The download instructions were really easy to follow, the designs are all individual and very well organized with a bundle preview with numbers. All the designs I have used were very well made and worked perfectly with my cutter. I am very happy with my purchase. Kudos! Thank you Anita for your great work and for making my work so much easier too! | Easy to use and resize for medium. | Awesome files! Very easy to add names. | I do not like the quality of item | a great product and file | Great quality, everything I was looking for easy download. Fast and efficient! Thank you Much appreciated and loved. | I would just like to make people aware that you DO NOT get 1,260 different variations of the Celtic tree. You get 70 different variations. The 1,260 number comes from those 70 different variations being available in SVG, PNG, PDF and JPG format and also in a &quot;dark&quot; and a &quot;light&quot; version. I feel as if advertising 1,260 so large on the first picture you see is done on purpose, with the seller knowing what he/she is doing and knowing they are purposely misleading customers. Could I have read the description? Yes. But honestly, who reads the description on a digital file they are purchasing on Etsy? I have been purchasing files on Etsy for years and I don&#39;t think I have ever read a description. As far as downloading goes, it was fairly easy and the files uploaded to my software fine, I just really don&#39;t like the deceptive marketing. | Great files, easy to identify, highly recommend! A great addition to my ever-expanding library. Thank you. | Excellent clip art.

Will definitely buy more! | Perfect linen fitted sheet! The color is beautiful and the material is very pleasant to sleep on, breathable and comfortable :) can recommend. | Love it! The pure white is practically glowing, and we were surprised by how soft the material is. There&#39;s a texture to the linen that&#39;s really pleasant to touch, and I&#39;ve noticed the sheet sleeps cooler than our old percale. Looking forward to when our duvet and top sheet need replacing and we can replace those with SoLinen products too!\n\nOur mattress is a bit tall, and I measured it at 15&quot; deep, so I bought the 16&quot; deep fitted sheet to be safe. I could have gone for a smaller depth, since with wear the material has relaxed a bit and is a little loose, but not so much to bother us. | Two sheets and some pillowcases arrived in great condition. I like them and my guests have admired them. | We love our cover! The linen is high quality and the cover is well-made. I made a mistake in the fabric I chose when ordering and they very kindly changed it to the one I wanted when I wrote‚Äîcustomer service was excellent and I also got shipping upgraded for free.

I love their linen SO much and it truly gets better over time. If you think you don&#39;t like linen, it&#39;s because you&#39;ve never bought quality linen. The good stuff is so worth it! This time I also bought 2 pillowcases. I have a king pillow and my spouse uses a standard pillow, so it was nice to buy one in each size without having to buy a set. Perfect! Love these sheets and I&#39;m sure I will have them for a long long time. | This was a gift and my friend was very pleased.  After struggling with the quality of some retail linen sheets, this one met with his approval.

The color is beautiful and texture is great! | Just what I wanted and color is exactly the same as the pictures! | Great quality product.

The material is perfect and it fits great.  Their work is always impeccable | Pure white as described classic linen sheet.

Great communication from seller. | I&#39;ve purchased these with a set of sheets and everything is so beautiful! Im in love!\nI can&#39;t take a good picture because my room is small but maybe it helps.\nThe feel like heaven an all in all it the most beautiful set I&#39;ve ever owned! :) | So sweet! The owner reached out and offered free expedited shipping. I had ordered sheets and pillowcases from them a few years ago, but I was missing a fitted sheet (using a cheap one from Amazon, which finally gave out and had tons of holes).

656856067," | I loved it! It was put together well  and had everything I needed. The only thing I think that was needed is a little more help on characters and what to do. The reason I say this is not every one has a strong imagination nor good at improv and so they need more help. \nOtherwise, thank you Chelsea! | This was an AWESOME party game for my best friends 30th birthday. Everyone got into character and couldn‚Äôt figure out who did it! 10/10 recommend. | We didn‚Äôt know what to expect or how our guests would respond (we surprised them upon arrival to the party). Everyone not only loved the idea of it, but LOVED the game and storyline. There was a character named Bo Handcock, which the guest assigned that character changed to Bro Hancock and now insists that we call him that forever! Everyone had so much fun and is now planning on another party, but this time bigger, better and planned out for the guests to prepare for their role ahead of time. But it worked out great even considering our guests had no time beforehand to get into character, it was easy enough to jump right in. Cannot recommend enough! | Love this! Came with everything I needed and did much advice on how to throw a murder mystery! I‚Äôm so excited and can not wait until next Month to throw it. Shipped quickly and would def buy from here again!! | The customer service was EXCELLENT! She was quick to answer my questions and help me cater a box kit to my party‚Äôs needs. It was a great time! Thanks! | Shipped quickly and SO fun! We had nearly 30 guests and everyone was able to get involved. What an awesome product!!! So original and creative. Thank you! | Party pack was great and seller was super transparent about shipping times. Everyone had a blast!  Out of a group of 29 no one got the murderer. | This was by far the best party we have had in a long time. The kit made it so easy to host. All of our friends are still talking about it! Thank you! | Can‚Äôt wait to try it out! | This was incredibly fun. I highly recommend the full kit. It is such a time saver and printed with high quality. | The kit arrived in a timely manner. More than enough time to pass on the characters to attendees. I love the texture of the items in the kit. The colors are amazing; can&#39;t wait to take on this assignment. I will post photos after the party! | Super Fun & Creative! Superb writing! It was Perfect for my daughter‚Äôs Sweet 16 party! 20 kids were entertained for hours! I extended the time line because they were having such a good time! The kit was shipped right away, with outstanding service and communication. If you‚Äôre looking for something to get your teenagers or adults to unplug and engage, this is the best option! | I just received the kit and cannot wait to have our event. \nChelsea was amazing to work with. | Wow!  My daughter and her friends are very excited to participate in the 1920&#39;s Murder Mystery.  The materials look fantastic and the packaging was lovely.  Thanks Chelsea! | Bought for a bachelorette party, it was a blast and so easy from a host perspective!! | Can not wait to have my party! She shipped the day after I ordered and it arrived a day early! Amazing quality and the Host guide is so helpful! Will be ordering from her again. | This box was fantastic!!! Everyone had great character cards with info which kept the party moving with conversation and fights! I would definitely do this again! | So excited for my party next month! Received my box yesterday and am so excited about all the little details for each character. \nWonderful customer service. Very quick to respond and answered every question. | This was so much fun! All items came printed and organized for us to use. My friends had a blast! | Its so pretty and wonderful quality!! I absolutely cant wait to play! Chelsea was so helpful and kind. she answered any questions i had about characters and hosting! Im definitely buying another game from her again in the future~ | Extremely quick shipping.  Looks amazing. | I had my party last night and it was a hit!!  This kit had everything needed to have a great time.  The seller was great and the kit shipped very quickly.  My friends and I will be back for more murder mystery parties! | Fast Shipping! The box looks great so excited to use it! | Had the best time using this party set! | Top notch business! Great Product! | We had a blast! Chelsea was so responsive leading up to my purchase and beyond. Such a fun way to celebrate a birthday! | This was my first murder mystery party and it was amazing! Everyone was super into their characters and dressed up. It was so well organized that as the host I could enjoy the whole experience as well. Well worth the money and now all my friends want to throw a murder mystery party! If I could rate this 100/10 I would. \n\nSuggestion for setting up the murder mystery environment. I ordered light bulbs that could change color and had it on red with one regular light on. It provided a great speakeasy atmosphere (hosted it at night time)! Especially during the murders üôÇ | We had a great and very successful murder mystery party using this kit. It&#39;s so convenient that everything is printed and ready to go. The mystery was intriguing and not obvious and the seller answered last minute questions quickly. Highly recommend! I&#39;ll be purchasing another kit for my next party. | This was such a fun and fantastic game, I would highly recommend! We did this for my sister&#39;s 40th. And Chelsea was so great to work with and was very responsive to answer questions. | We had a blast!  Looking forward to our 4th Annual NYE mystery party. in 2021  Our return guests loved the format of this mystery party.  Such fun! | Beautifully packaged and great quality I can‚Äôt wait for my party to use everything! | Our kit arrived quickly and is so well organized, thought out and fun! | We had the best time!! I can‚Äôt wait to do a new one next year!! | Second murder mystery party I have hosted, and I must say this has been my favorite! Far better than a different brand I tried. The game is set up in a great way that allows for organic mingling and a great time was had by all! I&#39;ll definitely be getting more! | Chelsea made a few tweaks at my request to suit a younger teen audience and included a male character for our one boy guest. Everything arrived in perfect order and the party was a hit with my 14-year-old and her friends! Highly recommend! | I saw videos of this pack on tik tok and the item I received wasn‚Äôt anything like what was advertised in the video. Just a little disappointed and confused, it feels like the pack is missing items and important information compared to other murder mystery kits we‚Äôve done in the past. I would have gone with the digital download and done it all myself had I realized the printed version was nothing like what I saw in the tik tok video. | These are absolutely perfect! Chelsea is super responsive with questions/requests and puts a ton of effort into the little details, which truly make this wonderful! | Awesome and all the extras are amazing. Great details and cannot wait to play | Quality of this product is amazing! So excited to be hosting our first ever murder mystery party and this kit makes everything so much easier | This was so fun and the cards were beautiful! We played with a group of 24 people and this was engaging for all characters! I had a lot of fun matching the character cards to my friends and there was a wide range of ways for people to get involved | Wow what a party! I was so impressed with how the characters‚Äô personalities were easy to mimic yet they were still complex enough to have regular conversations throughout the night. I was shocked by just how imaginative our guests were when dressing and acting like their characters! They really got into it!\n\nThe storyline was equally creative and literally no one out of our 15 guests were able to guess the ending even though the answer was right in front of us the entire time!\n\nI made tweaks to the party as a whole to make it more interesting and tailored to our group and I suggest that other party planners to do the same. For instance, I made a poster of the layout of our house and then subsequently put a red X at each location that a murder took place throughout the evening. Things like this made it even more fun! | Item was perfect! Came in cute wrapping and the tips are super helpful. I can‚Äôt wait for my party | Chelsea is absolutely amazing! She was so swift at creating our rush order, and did one hell of a job with all the materials! Every person enjoyed the game and we couldn‚Äôt be more happy! If you‚Äôre looking for a murder mystery‚Äî BUY THIS ONE! | We are SO excited to have a murder mystery party kit that‚Äôs completely ready to go like this one. All we need to do is add guests, food & drink! It was shipped promptly, marvelously packed & everything is in place for our night of mayhem, mystery & murder! Thanks for such a great product! | We had a blast going back to the roaring 20s and solving some muuurrrdddeeerrrss!\n\nEverything was easily set up for us and not too hard to follow! | We had so much fun with this kit! Highly recommend! Next time, I would use more action cards (we kind of forgot about those). Some folks were more invested in the character and made up extra story line, others didn&#39;t. Those who did felt more involved and had an even better time :) Can&#39;t wait for the Halloween edition for next year! | This was everything we hoped it to be and more! It was so well organized and led to such a fun night.\n\nAs an added bonus, we had 2 people drop out at the last minute and Chelsea was so amazing and responsive about making last minute changes!\n\nCan‚Äôt recommend highly enough. | The box kit is definitely worth it. The game was pretty self explanatory. I would suggest watching the linked YouTube video. Will definitely order again. So fun !!! | She is very responsive over messages and the box is so beautifully organized! | I had specific questions to make sure this set was going to work for our staff party. Reponses were thorough and quick! | Awesome kit! Everything was printed perfectly and so easy to understand as the host! We had the best night and my friends are already asking when we can do another one! Highly suggest! | Thank you so much for making my 29th birthday so special and easy to plan! My only suggestion for future hosts would be to be careful about the conclusion page. I was unclear that by reading it I would find out who the murderer was so when I briefly glanced at it, I unfortunately ruined the game for myself and couldn‚Äôt participate with my friends. | Awesome!  Exactly what i expected | Threw a small murder mystery engagement party for two of our friends and this kit was an absolute hit. Was absolutely hilarious having everyone show up in their costumes and act out their characters through the evening. Definitely recommend this kit for anyone who wants to throw a super fun party! Chelsea was even able to alter the introduction for me to incorporate the city our friends met and include their dog in the story! | I am giving this is a gift and I hope I will be invited to the murder mystery dinner! | For my 30th birthday I wanted to have a Murder Mystery Dinner Party. I purchased a kit from another Etsy seller before coming across Murders Incorporated and I am disappointed I spent my money elsewhere, because there was no mystery left for me with the other seller. I found Murders Incorporated and promptly purchased when I learned that Chelsea creates the kits to keep the murderer a surprise if you‚Äôre hosting. Chelsea, the owner, assisted me with my special requests and shipped everything quickly. I was so pleased by the presentation. When I opened the box, it was like an early birthday present for myself. My dinner party was a huge success, the plot was interesting & creative. I will be purchasing from Murders Incorporated again in the future! | Beautifully thought out, interesting characters. We did this with my family for Christmas Eve and it was an absolute hit! | An absolute blast! The Murder Mystery was well put together, super easy to use and most importantly a memorable and fun night for my group. The seller was amazing and super easy to communicate with and incredibly helpful. I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone looking for a unforgettable party experience. I‚Äôm already planning our next purchase! | We LOVED this! We had such a blast! 10/10 would recommend and will be purchasing again from this creator! | This was simply amazing. The detail was incredible. We had 19 players and everyone left saying how much fun they had!! | Loved it! We had a blast. Had 17 people. We were a little confused by the secondary clues but other than that it was pretty easy! The only thing I wish was for price, there should be alternate ending or murders or scenarios. It‚Äôs a lot to use only once | The kit is fantastic! We had a lot of fun! | Had a great time as first time hosts! The kit made it easy to follow and everyone had a great time! | This my first murder mystery party and I was nervous but once I received the kit I realized how easy it was and how everything was so well instructed. My guests love it! | Super friendly and quick to respond! \nThis is everything and more!! | What a wonderful experience and a wonderful product! I swear Etsy shops have some of the best customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had, and this shop is at the top of that list! My family has done numerous murder mystery boxes but I needed one for a big group for an after wedding ‚Äúmasters‚Äù party. I am mailing out everyone‚Äôs player personas tomorrow and I am beyond excited! Thanks again! | This is the one. Look no further. This is the murder mystery you‚Äôre looking for. Everything about it is 5/5 stars. The characters, the storyline, the product itself, Chelsea‚Äôs customer service. It is simple and efficient to host straight out of the box and elaborate enough that your guests will think you‚Äôve spent months rehearsing and coordinating. It is good ‚Äúas is‚Äù or you can add props and costumes and hype to build the excitement and suspense. We had a party of 11 and randomly drew characters from a hat about 3 weeks before the party. Guests started getting into character and purchasing costumes around then  and even started communicating with each other‚Äôs important relationships. We played it at a lodge in the Adirondacks that had a bar in it, contributing perfectly to the Speakeasy setting. We talk about it every day since | I highly recommend this set, especially for first time murder mystery hosts. It was easy, low stress, and so much fun. \n\nAs someone who has hosted another murder mystery from a different company in the past, this one was far better. It exceeded my expectations because of its ease of hosting, great characters/storyline, and all the extras that came in the pack. My guests absolutely loved the event and it was so fun seeing everyone get so into character, even my more introverted guests. \n\nI also ended up buying an expansion pack for 20-30 guests. It scaled wonderfully with 27 guests-  the secondary & tertiary characters got just as into the mystery as the primary characters and didn‚Äôt feel left out.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a fun and easy-to- host murder mystery for a large group - don‚Äôt hesitate. This is the one to get! | OMGEEEE!!!!  Best experience EVER!!!!!  Super professional!!  Looked at the amount of females versus males and emailed me to make it perfect!!!  Products came quickly and better than described.  So excited and can&#39;t wait for the party!!!!  Will do business again!!! | Oh my gosh this was an AMAZING experience! Chelsea really thinks of everything, and she&#39;s responsive to questions (we had an essential character who was a &quot;maybe&quot; to attend, so I had to be creative with invites.) I was really amazed how much our friends got into this as a birthday party - it was so much fun!! Would absolutely recommend this set. the host timeline was so, so helpful. I also enjoyed that I could choose to be surprised by the ending, too. Great product!! | Well worth purchasing! Everyone had a great time and are still talking about it ü•≥ | It came very nicely packaged with directions on how to set everything up. You have the option of knowing who the murderer is or not knowing so the host can play as well. It was fun matching up the characters to friends and family members based on the descriptions on the cards. The only thing I wished was in the package was name tags for the guests but I ended up making my own. We will for sure do this again with another theme. | The box kit is definitely worth it. The game was pretty self explanatory. I would suggest watching the linked YouTube video. Will definitely order again. So fun !!! | Super fun, creative, and high quality. Perfect for a fun night with friends!! | Walks through everything which is great for a first timer like me. I would suggest maybe adding invitations the host can send out but besides that I‚Äôm very happy with how detailed the full box is üòÉ | This was such a fun night! Well thought out game and we had a blast! I purchased the Zoom edition in 2020 and I‚Äôm so glad I got to do this again in 2024! | It is absolutely lovely! So excite to host the party, I read through the host instructions and it is easy to understand and sounds so fun :) Definitely recommend!! | Well, well prepared! The game was constructed in an easy-to-follow manner. Everyone had fun and we had thirty people playing! | As a host, it&#39;s great having a script/character assignments, and I love how the murderer is a secret to me, too! My friends + I couldn&#39;t be more excited for this! | The party was so fun!  We had a great time solving! | This was my first murder mystery party and this kit was PERFECT! It had everything I needed and I was so excited when I got it in the mail. I definitely recommend you order it with enough time though so your guests have at least 2 weeks to order items for their costumes and put it together but I have nothing negative to say about the kit itself!!! | She answered all my questions! She has YouTube videos to explain everything. Very handy and helpful! | Great party supplies\nAnd theme. Was a hit. | The game was super fun! Everyone loved their characters! | What a night! This is such a unique dinner game night! Everything I needed to host an unforgettable murder mystery dinner party was included (besides the food). I gave my guests their character cards ahead of time and everyone dressed for their part. The whole night went down seamlessly.  I will definitely purchase another theme in the future! | So cute loved it so much | very detailed, worth it, very happy | This was an EXCELLENT kit and helped create an amazing and memorable evening! The box came quickly and was very organized. All items were printed clearly and on good quality paper. Chelsea is responsive and helpful, and I would definitely purchase from her again. | Great Game! A+. Very fun and interactive. | Phenomenal job!!!!! Everything was so well done and top notch! Will be ordering from her again!!!!!!!!! | This is so much more than I was expecting! I purchased it for a birthday party in July and I can&#39;t wait! | Amazing time! As the host was very easy to run and everyone got super into it! Must buy for any occasion of fun üòä | This seller was so helpful and patient, when I wanted to buy four extra wine bottle labels she adjusted the payment and put them in without any complaints and answered all my questions about characters and the mystery plot, she was super helpful and kind, i am so excited to do this party. And i hope she comes up with a lot more mysteries for people to buy. | Everything was great and it made for an extremely fun party. Will be back to buy more in the future! | Our Murder Mystery party was fantastic! We chose the 1920&#39;s theme and went for the option to have all the nicely printed materials sent to us ahead of time. The characters were all fun and had their own motivations that we got to dig into and we all appreciated the helpful costume tips and opportunities to Make A Scene! I will say, I opted not to know who the murderer was so that it could be a surprise to everyone, including myself. I love that we are given that option, but I would recommend the host and the killer knowing who they are so they can act accordingly and have fun possibly getting away with it. \n\nNot only was the event a success, but MurdersIncorporated was extremely helpful and communicative and answered my questions quickly. I would highly recommend this shop, especially the 1920&#39;s murder at the speakeasy. | This murder mystery party was so fun and easy to follow! Everyone had a blast and I love how it included awards for the end of the night. The seller was super helpful and quick to respond and we will definitely order from this shop again! | Customer service was excellent. I made a mistake when ordering and i reached out and Chelsea made it right! Such great quality. I can‚Äôt wait for our party this weekend! | We had a small get together for my husband&#39;s thirtieth birthday and it was a huge hit! The directions were easy to follow, the identity cards were straight forward, and everyone got into character. | We had so much fun. Thank you! | This party was an absolute BLAST! Look no further for your murder mystery party needs. Loved the option for the host to remain in the dark about who the murderer was too. | excellent!! very cool kit with lots of extras!!! totally awesome!! will buy another one from this vendor. | What a fun party!!! Chelsea made this evening everything and more! It was so well thought out and the instructions were so easy to follow!! Not to mention the characters and deaths were hilarious and well acted out! Everyone wants to do a murder party next year!!! | Party next month, can‚Äôt wait | Awesome Quality cant wait to host this party | Awesome and well thought out. This party was great and unique. We will be hearing people rave about it for years to come. | I&#39;m obsessed and will definitely be ordering more! It was the perfect event for a large crowd and EVERYONE loved it! Chelsea was so accommodating and even sent me the PDF right before she got married! The murderer was difficult to figure out but myself and one other person did! | Love this! Can‚Äôt wait for my 30th birthday party | We had the best time and everything was put together so it was a breeze! We ended up with 50 guests total and purchased the kit for 30 so it worked perfectly. The ‚Äúextras‚Äù just came as themselves and played along like everyone else. We are already looking forward to hosting a second party (and so are our guests) | Fast shipping, great quality!  Excited to have our PG version party! | Omg! This was amazing! It had everything I needed to host my murder mystery party. It‚Äôs all well organized and put together. Stress free!! We all had such a blast! It was definitely a night of fun memories!! | I got this for a bachelorette party and everyone had so much fun!! | We all look forward to our murder mystery night. Good quality product and instructions. | I was nervous about throwing my first murder mystery party. This kit really helped. We had a blast. | Hosted the party for 10 people last night. We had it setup outside around a bonfire on a gorgeous fall night. It was an absolute BLAST! Everyone got really into their characters and lots of laughs (and champagne) were had. We had 4 people correctly guess the murderer so it was tricky enough to make it interesting, but not impossible. Highly highly recommend and will certainly buy another party from Chelsea soon!! | great party in a package :) | I purchased this for my daughter‚Äôs 13th Birthday party. I was a little concerned how this would play out because I‚Äôve never attended or hosted a Murder Mystery Party. The girls all dressed up in their assigned characters. My daughter hand made invitations and included copies of their character in them. It was adorable! \n\nMy only suggestion would be to modify any character trait that may not be age appropriate. We changed a call girl to a model. Just make it yours. It may cost to have everything printed but it‚Äôs a cost saver when it comes to time, money, and stress. So glad we had everything ready to go for a memorable birthday! | Great quality and exciting story! We look forward to playing it on New Year‚Äôs Eve! | Such a blast! 10/10 Recommend | Got this for my sister&#39;s bachelorette, and it was SO much fun! Everyone got really into it and dressed up, and it was awesome to see the extra backstory layers that people put into their characters.\n\nI noticed the chara descriptions are pretty loose -- which is good, if you want creative freedom, and maybe not-so-good, when it comes to trying to make backstories consistent. For our group it was perfect, though, and we really enjoyed the night! Would highly recommend. &lt;3 | Great murder mystery set! Comes with everything you need and then some. Shop owner is responsive and helpful through messages. Can&#39;t wait to have our party! | Bought this kit for my daughter‚Äôs 14th birthday party. We (teens and adults) | This game was SO fun. Our family had a great time. I highly reccomend! We had 27 people and it was perfect because there are different tiers of participants so everyone could participate at their comfortability level. | This is perfect! Chelsea has been available anytime I needed her even for the silliest of questions. She provided such easy instructions. Will buy again!! | This was the best birthday party I‚Äôve had as an adult! It was so much fun. Absolutely loved the timeline that came with it and the fact that I  (as the host) also didn‚Äôt know who the killer was! | my guests and I had a stupendous time!! Chelsea is so detailed in her kits and available to answer any questions which took the stress out of hosting so that I could have fun and play along too!! I would absolutely order from this shop again- the open ended layout of the night was so fun and everyone could really make their character their own. | I highly recommend this! My son wanted a game like this for his 12th birthday and I struggled to find one that matched all his criteria, especially one for guys and girls together. The PG version of this game was perfect! The kids had a fancy dinner party, they were all in costume and in character, and nearly half of them got named the murderer so it wasn‚Äôt too difficult for 6th graders (something I was concerned about). This may be a new birthday tradition for him! I ordered the complete box since his bday is right after Christmas and I didn‚Äôt want one more errand to print it all myself. Everything arrived in a lovely box and really prepared me well as the host. The only extras I bought were pens and notepads but they weren‚Äôt even necessary. The seller was immensely helpful and readily available for my questions. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | We had the best time, insane amounts of laughs and at times felt like we all went a little crazy. It was an incredible night of murder mystery. Everyone really got into character even those you would never expect to. This is a very unique way to have a great time and this kit made it so easy. Never been or hosted a murder mystery and everyone was super impressed. Thank you for making it so easy to follow! | The kit was awesome and the storyline was great. My friends and I had a fabulous time. Highly recommend! | Everything was perfect! Glad I went with the printed kit! I did this as a surprise for my boyfriend. Everyone that came will be talking about this party for some time I know it. It was a first experience for everyone and everyone was so into it. We never got a group pick but the guys are pictured in the photo I uploaded.  Highly recommended! | The seller is very quick to respond to questions, and the packaging of the game is beautiful and on nice quality card stock. This is going to be so much fun to play! | I am so excited to host my party. I was not sure how I was going to handle this and I went on here and searched and found y&#39;all. It looks amazing! Thank you. | We had such a great time! I hosted the party and randomly drew the action card ‚Äúpull a piece of evidence‚Äù, so I pulled the main piece of evidence that would‚Äôve helped everyone guess who did it. So in the end no one guess correctly, but we had some amazing guesses! And we had a great time. | The seller was extremely accommodating!!! I needed the product ASAP and I received it 2 days after speaking to the seller. I‚Äôm very appreciative of this because my wife‚Äôs birthday was right around the corner. | Perfect!! I love this game | The game itself was a ton of fun and the story was great. The price difference between the downloadable version and the printed version is too much for what is printed. The decorations provided are not helpful. It would make for a more quality and worth the price difference if the decorations were ditched and a better Instructions for the Host booklet was made. A booklet with the prompts for the host separate from the general I structuring would be nice as well. Something that could almost serve as a prop. \n\nThe story was fun and worth the downloadable price. | So fun!! We had a great family night! | Arrived early and as expected, excited to gift this to family for the holidays! | Everything about this order was above and beyond. Chelsea answered ALL of my questions ahead of my order shipping. And the full kit could not have been easier to follow. My friends and I had an amazing time!! | The box set was so cute and easy to follow, and Chelsea was super helpful with my questions and making sure it was delivered in time :). Would totally recommend for anyone looking to host an event like this! Only 2 out of about 30 guests guessed the murderer. | I was skeptical about the cost and the quality not meeting my expectations. however I can happily say I am beyond happy with everything!! still have yet to do the party (that&#39;s in a few more days) but the instructions were through and everyone is excited to play. the tips included are very helpful as well if you&#39;ve never done a murder mystery before and will definitely help make everything be more immersive.","Buyers mention that the kits are well-organized, easy to use, and come with everything needed to host a murder mystery party, with clear instructions and helpful host guides, and many appreciate the quick shipping and excellent customer service."

1204976232,"Loving my edc wallet. Its ever so slightly thinner than I thought but it is still perfect. The quality of the product is excellent. \nThe package came with stickers, a fabric pouch and a pen sleeve which I am using now with my favourite fountain pen and to go with the excellent pocket everyday book that I also purchased from Galen.\nI had the best experience shopping on this store, no problems with shipping whatsoever, everything came in perfect condition and you can see the care and dedication they have in every product. Already eyeing some other Galen products! | The quality of this item is very, very good, especially for the reasonable price. That said, I likely won‚Äôt get a ton of use out of it because of how unstructured the storage is - I‚Äôm not totally sure who would load this thing up with multi tools and have them in there untethered and only kept there by friction. And because of the size of the main compartment, I don‚Äôt really feel comfortable placing other wallet items in there. For these reasons, I would recommend that the seller add some elastic or compartments to help organize things on that side or make it an option. Again, otherwise a super nice product, just less useful for my needs than I had hoped. | If you want a stylish EDC pouch, this is the one to get. The quality is great. I have been using it for a few months now, and it still looks like new. 5 stars | jiust what i wanted works great thanks | Quality product and great price | Great wallet, zipper is good quality, would like an additional pouch slot maybe | Excellent EDC wallet. Great transaction! | I use this wallet as a mini edc pouch.  It keeps my items together and prevents damage to my pockets and pants. | Ordered item and was billed but it never shipped.  I would avoid this seller.","The EDC wallet is praised for its quality, stylishness, and functionality as a mini EDC pouch, with some users suggesting additional pouches or compartments for better organization; however, one user reported an issue with the order not being shipped."

I‚Äôm NHS & have to wear clinical mask all day at work; so lovey to have quality mask when not at work. Easy to wash & dry. | The quality is excellent but knocked off one star as the actual width of the mask material could be bigger to fit a larger mans face properly, and also the ties I would have preferred a pull clasp instead of having to do a knot yourself | It was my error for not checking, but adjustable straps would be ideal. My partner has to use an extender strap, though in fairness, he does have a non-standard shaped head (meant with love!). | Exceptional quality.

794064337,"Perfect jacket!!!! | I wanted to love this jacket so much. I was so excited. I originally purchased one of the heathered style in black (which is really grey) loved the jacket but it was way too big. I usually fit comfortably in a large (5‚Äô4‚Äù 170) so that‚Äôs what I ordered. I was bummed when it was way too big, so I ordered the black-non heathered in a medium. This one is actually black which I was happy about but it fits more like a small so now this one is way too small. No returns or exchanges on customized items (understandable) but frustrating that I‚Äôve now spent over $100 and have no jacket that fits to show for it. Very inconsistent sizes. The design is great and the customization was perfect. Just wish it fit üòî | Absolutely love this sweater! Fits true to size and I get so many compliments at work! | Perfect. I‚Äôm glad I purchased the jacket. | Love this jacket!! I am 5‚Äô3 and 125 pounds, I ordered a small and it fits perfectly! If you want more wiggle room I suggest sizing up.  I ordered the light weight fleece and it is is warm and cozy but not too heavy. | Love it thank you so much! | I love it ! Very soft and true to size. | Made so quickly. Fits perfectly. Looks great! | The jacket is not too thin or not too thick, design stands out | Really terrific jacket that will be useful during cold night on the unit.

Can&#39;t wait to wear this to work | Fits perfect and looks amazing | The original jacket I ordered was out of stock in my size. Seller reached out quickly with other options or a refund. I picked another option and had to me within a week. I LOVE IT and can‚Äôt wait to wear to work!! | Excellent store shipping was great product is nice well made I had a great experience with this shop | So comfortable ordered a medium, fits perfect. I&#39;m 5&#39;6 135lbs. Made very nicely! | I should have ordered an XL for just a bit more room but, nonetheless I Love My Jacket. | This is a lovely. I can&#39;t wait to wear it to work. | I love it.  ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è \nWish I had purchased a larger size.  But, again I love it. | This jacket is amazing and everyone loves it. | Nice design, the quality of the jacket wasn‚Äôt what I expected | Very well crafted, looks beautiful on. Fast shipping and packaged well.","Buyers love the jacket and its design, noting it fits perfectly and is comfortable, with some recommending sizing up for more room; the jacket is suitable for work, and the customization is well-received, though some experienced size inconsistencies."

I got my sisters and my names on the rings as a gift for my mom and it turned out exactly how i was hoping for it to look! | I really liked how clear the names are.\nA great necklace! | I ordered this for my mom for mother&#39;s day. She got her first two grandbabies within 6 months of each other this year! I added their first and middle names. She absolutely loved it! | I ordered the five ring necklace for my mom&#39;s birthday. I&#39;m happy with the design but also surprised and really broken hearted that the names don&#39;t all show. The way the rings hang, only two or three of the names show and the others face the opposite direction. I would have paid more to have the names stamped on both sides had I known this would be a problem. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even give it to my mom unless I can find a local engraver to stamp the other sides. I took photos but the review doesn&#39;t have a way to upload. \n\nEDITED: I upgraded the review to five stars. Michelle offered to send another necklace. Won&#39;t be on time for my mom&#39;s birthday - but it will be even better as a &quot;no reason except I love you&quot; gift! Very grateful. | My wife loved it. A great quality and beautiful design. \nHighly recommending!!\nThank you so much. | I really love this necklace! The quality is good but do note that the circles are quite thin. If I could change anything, a little more substance for each ring would be great. I&#39;m still very happy with my necklace. Thank you! | The piece is very delicate, but perfect for a birthday gift for my sis-in-law. I wanted to get her something custom, but not something super expensive. She doesn‚Äôt have to worry about losing or damaging it. Michelle was great. She sent me the estimated time of delivery and I messaged her and asked if there was any way it could be slightly sooner for the birthday gift. Not only did she make it in time for the bday party, but she made it arrive even earlier than she had promised. Great communication and great service. My sis-in-law loved it. | So lovely :) My Mom-in-law was so surprised, and loved the way it laid when she put it on. Mine was a custom order with four rings, and when on, the rings laid out very nicely next to each other. The necklace itself was delicate in appearance, but not in construction. Definitely a wonderful purchase. Thank you! | Michelle is very communicative and responded to all my questions immediately. The necklaces didn‚Äôt appear to have shipped from the usps tracking number and she immediately offered an alternate solution‚Äîand thankfully in the end they arrived just on time. All that said‚Äîthe necklaces are gorgeous! My sister (her kids), my mom, and I all love them. So elegant, simple and personal. I would buy these for friends too. And they arrived in a beautiful gift box! | Got this for my daughter. She is going to love it! Seller was great and they arrived sooner that expected! | This was a great gift! It looks just like the images. | Thank you, it was perfect! | The loops keep twisting and you can‚Äôt really see the names. Other than that it‚Äôs very cute. | I LOVE my necklace! Get lots of compliments on it. The only negative I can say is that it is difficult to get it to lay with all 3 names showing. Possibly having both sides stamped might alleviate this issue. | Long process to receive it. After I ordered it, I found out it wouldn‚Äôt ship until 3 weeks later, after I needed it for a birthday. Luckily, my sister in law is understanding. The necklace was half hanging out of the plastic jewelry bag that they wrote it should be in an air tight bag so the sterling silver should stay protected. Overall wasn‚Äôt really impressed by the wait time and then opening it up and seeing the necklace half out of the bag. It was sealed with the necklace half out. So it‚Äôs not like it was opened while it was shipped or something. Took forever to be shipped and they clearly didn‚Äôt take the time to package it correctly. | I had matching necklaces sent to my cousin and her wife on the birth of their son and I specifically asked for a card and gift wrapping. The package was delivered on the date but it‚Äôs been several days and I got no response from either of the new parents. Turns out, after confirming that a card will be put, the seller did not in fact put it. And they had no idea who sent them the gift. They made calls all around asking who sent the necklaces. What a shitty way to give a present! Feel embarrassed and awful. The seller ruined this experience for me. Now I‚Äôm wondering if she had the sense to remove the receipt of payment and price of the items from the gift!!!!! Do NOT trust her to follow specia instructions even if she says no problem. | I am THRILLED with this absolutely gorgeous piece!!! Not only is it beautifully made (delicate without feeling flimsy, beautiful craftsmanship), but the customer service is top notch and the presentation in its lovely little box is a wonderful touch. I will absolutely be purchasing from this store again and can‚Äôt wait to gift this to my mom - she will treasure it!! Thank you for the perfect one of a kind gift!! | Pleasantly surprised all 5 rings were able to fit my kids long names. The packaging is very cute and had lots of personal touches to it. The necklace fits as expected and it seems to be of good quality. I have received many compliments for this unique item. I will definitely buy from this seller again. | Great item. My wife loves it | I got it before my wife as a just because gift and she absolutely loves it and wears it every single day hasn&#39;t taken it off in weeks | Love it!

Thank you!!! | I had to ask to change my address and they responded in a timely manner.

She loved it. | So beautiful it&#39;s personal and lovely! thank you again and like previously always a pleasure to purchase from you | My sister loves the gift | Great necklace.

Maybe it rubbed her the wrong way but I was being super nice & still paid for it instead of complaining & demanding a new one for free? I messaged her & she didn‚Äôt respond. Days later I messaged her again saying if it has even been shipped out yet & she responded blaming it on USPS. Literally right after our conversation, it said the label was barely created.

734508902,"These work great with my Oakley Holbrook Rx Sunglasses.  I&#39;m vision impaired with light sensitivity and these definitely help. | A+ product! Will buy again. | Just what I was looking for.  Shipping time was actually reasonable. One thing to consider is how wide the part of the sunglass is where this is going.  I didn&#39;t think about that and my arms were wide so it was a tight fit but it did fit with some minimal working it. | Great quality. They really block the glare, but of course decrease side vision a bit when driving. Easy to put on to glasses. | These are perfect for the Rayban Meta glasses. I was uncertain they would fit but after the leather breaks in it‚Äôs quite nice. You have to scrunch them a bit to fit in the carrying case and access the power switch but all in all great upgrade to the Meta glasses. | This is a gift I have t given, so can‚Äôt comment on utility. It took far longer than predicted to arrive. My regret is it looks homemade. Grommets aren‚Äôt lined up. Edge cuts are a bit ragged. Hopefully they will work on my husbands sunglasses. His eyes water a lot from wind. | Just as described. Good packaging with prompt shipping. Great Seller! | Amazing! They actually work really well for rayban meta regular size not the XL, does take convincing to pull onto the sizes the front rivet unpopped so i had to tie the holes together and works great. Does not let you charge seamlessly like before, you have to shove it in the case with the lid in order to connect and stay | So, let me start by saying that the quality and look is nice. I reached out to the store prior to the purchase and provided the type of glasses I had to see if these would fit. He responded to provide the width at the point of the temple arms, which I did. He then said these would fit. Upon receiving them, I can&#39;t even get them on the temple arms. I told him they were 1/2&quot; at the widest point and they were supposed to fit. They are not 1/2&quot; and they do not fit. For this reason, it is a 1 star. | great customer service I asked for special treatment on my glasses they came out of Brazil very well made thank you. | Excellent Product! Very well made, and so nice. | Fit perfect, Great quality.

For one, the entire knife was coated in varnish including the blade, this made the handle VERY uncomfortable to use and the blade covered in gunk until I removed it. My second point is about the sheath. It is only painted and protected on one side and it is patchy in most places that should be top priority when sealing leather ie: the loop and rivets. Overall tho I think it is a hood little knife and I cant complain about the price. | Nice knife great quality and service","Buyers describe the knives as well-made, sharp, and of great quality, also noting fast shipping; some buyers mention issues with the sheath being loose or needing tightening, while others find the handle comfortable; some buyers express concern that the knife is not handmade."

It took 5 weeks to arrive, and the print quality is not good. The cradle is peeling off print layers. | Came quickly and just as described. I can&#39;t wait to try it out. The packaging it came in was nice, too. It also came with a little cloth bag for storage. | Came packaged very well and everything works perfectly!! | Oh my gosh this product is soooo worth the money. Super fast delivery and very pleasant customer service. | Great quality & very handy in making books | Looking forward to using this bookbinding punch.  It makes the process much easier. | I ordered this item because about 45 days ago I managed to put put an awl through one side of a finger and out the other.  It was at that point I realized what I previously considered an extravagant and unneeded tool (a book cradle) was very much a necessity. I am very pleased with the size of the cradle, and love the nonslip foam on the bottom. I can&#39;t wait to use this on my current project. | This is a great tool for punching signatures in bookbinding. Very well made, sturdy and easy to use.

And they&#39;re so friendly to deal with! | Really love this tool and the neat storage pouch it came in.  My only critique is that you need to make sure you are using the same end of the punch for all of your signatures. The holes are not spaced evenly on either end. It came with some yellow discolouring which doesn't affect how the product works but does look stained.  Either way great product. | I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be 3D printed but that did not take away from the fact that it was extremely helpful. | Came very quick concidering I&#39;m in the UK also very well packed in pretty tissue and it&#39;s own hessian bag with a little gift too and awl üòÅ | I make coptic-bound journals for myself and for friends & family as gifts.

Thank you!! | Much, much smaller than expected, turns out I didn‚Äôt read the description so not a seller issue. There is a yellow,\nsticky residue on top of the cradle that I have to figure out how to remove before I use and I‚Äôll probably have to find a bigger one for the books I want to make, but this will be useful for making field notebooks for sketching and notes. Also took a lot longer to ship than anticipated but was also a holiday weekend so more understanding. | Tried out the jig on signature for a book... it made it so easy to punch holes evenly , exactly through the fold/ crease  and kept the awl from touching the table.... great product! | As described. Pro tip: mark one side as the head and the other as the tail. This helped make sure all the signatures were aligned perfectly. | Took a while to get here, but I&#39;m very happy with this purchase.

I ordered this as a gift for a friends birthday (pretty last minute on my part I may add) & I messaged Alex regarding a short deadline & he was not only very responsive, but was also able to meet my deadline for me due to my own poor planning. My friend & her family were head over heels with the photo and thought it was the coolest and cutest thing!! Several of them asked for the Etsy shop name because they liked it so much. I highly recommend this product & shop; I cannot thank Alex enough for the amazing job he did. He communicated very well, gave me a preview and option to ask to change anything before sending the final product, & even offered to edit the formatting if I needed it printed in a certain size.

The painting turned out better than I could‚Äôve expected! The communication between the artist and I was good and I appreciated how fast he got back to me and all the questions he asked to help my vision come to life! My only side note would be to read the description of the product clearly. I was under the impression that I was going to get my painting mailed to me and not get a digital version that I have to print out myself. Ether way the painting still turned out amazing! But other than that 10 out of 10 recommend | My portrait turned out so well my boyfriend loved it. The seller was so helpful and altered parts I needed to change. Lovely work | Alex was so easy to work with. And the prints turned out fantastic. Got three for my wife for Mother‚Äôs Day and I cannot wait to show her.

I had some edits for the original version sent over, and he updated the image to be what I wanted. Thanks! | Wonderful job with the portrait!

We ordered two portraits to be done if my parents and they came out beautifully! Alex is great also, very responsive and helpful! | The quality is good and the product itself looks good. But i do think, it&#39;s a little bit expensive for a portrait, that isn&#39;t hand-painted. | Customer service was amazing, helpful, and cooperative! However, after reviewing for a couple of days, the art was just not really clicking with me, and it just didn‚Äôt look good. I had initially expected better, and my fears were validated when the receiver of the gift mirrored my opinions. Overpriced for something that could be done much better for cheaper price and better quality. | It was great working with Alex! The details are pretty awesome and something I could never do, he has such great talent! Before sending me the final product, he gave me a preview and I asked him to change a few things and he did so in a timely manner. This will be printed off into a canvas and going up on our wall!

But seriously, if you‚Äôre looking for something that is done super well and will last a lifetime, please order one of these for the memories :) | Great communication & beautiful artwork! So happy! | Alex was super wonderful to work with. He was prompt in getting the job done and was super willing to make the revisions I asked him to make after the first draft. In fact, he had made four revisions according to the changes I asked for. \n\nI am super pleased with the final product and will be asking him for more products in the future! | I&#39;m very happy with Alexs&#39; work.

I love how the energy of the photo was captured in the image. | This is my 3rd time ordering from Alex and he is the absolute best!!!! As long as I‚Äôm on esty he will have business because he deserves it, he is so kind and rapid! Thank you Alex!!! | Great job and very easy to work with. Highly recommend. | Not only was the turnaround time even faster than what was stated, the artwork was breathtakingly good. I was a little nervous simply because based on sample pictures I‚Äôve seen from some artists (not him), these don‚Äôt always turn out good, but this picture looked even better than his samples. If you‚Äôre hesitating about buying this artwork, don‚Äôt‚Äîit‚Äôs unmatched. He has a real talent and the purchase was worth every penny, and I already plan to purchase again from this seller in the future. He created a beautiful photo of my girlfriend and I for Valentine‚Äôs Day, and I was so excited when I saw it that I ended up giving it to them as an early Valentine‚Äôs Day present since I just couldn‚Äôt wait anymore! Just, lovely artwork; I can‚Äôt wait to have it framed. | I ordered 2 as Christmas gifts- I‚Äôm such a procrastinator, so didn‚Äôt order until 2 days before. I paid for 2 rush orders which was kinda pricey- but I‚Äôd pay it all over again. Seller was quick to respond to messages/requests and was happy to make adjustments when asked. (And got them over for me to review within minutes)\nCouldn‚Äôt be happier with how they turned out. They are beautiful! By far my favorite Christmas gifts to my boys! | So easy to order-\nWorth every penny!\nTurned out beautifully! | really great. very happy with purchase. second time buying. | The portrait came out absolutely amazing! My jaw dropped when i saw the initial drawing- it was spot on and absolutely gorgeous. I highly recommend this as a gift for that special person!!! | Amazing work! My dad loved it | Loved it so much !! Will definitely order again | Seller was easy to work with and when I asked for a few changes, they were able to accommodate my requests. I&#39;m so pleased with the results of my portrait and I sent it to another company to have it printed onto a canvas. It turned out great!! I got it as a birthday present for my boyfriend and I can&#39;t wait to give it to him!! I will definitely be working with the seller again should I need a portrait like this done again. \n**PLEASE NOTE** Buying this you ONLY get the digital picture... NOT a canvas. If you want to print it onto a canvas like I did, you will need to find another company or person to pay to print it. I did include photos of it on the canvas though so you could get an idea of what your portrait might look like when printed out onto canvas. | The seller did an amazing job with my portrait . I definitely recommend getting this for someone as a gift . He was on point with communication and super helpful . I had asked for little touch ups that I wanted and he instantly added them. It turned out just how I wanted in the end .  ü§© | Awesome. Artist was friendly and very willing to accommodate ideas and changes. | Thanks great gift, nice work | I have had several prints done, and each time the recipient has been very pleased. | This was 1 of 2 pictures that I took of my best friend and her husband before he died from cancer.  He was feeling really good that day. | Ordered as a valentine gift for my husband and we are both very happy with the turnout. | There is no shipping as it is a digital copy only. It should state this when the product comes up in it‚Äôs name. Total rip off for the price as you could do this yourself on your phone. Is not handmade as they are just plugging it in to software. Would not let me cancel order when I found out it was not a actual shipped product. Would not recommend unless you want to spend close to 50 for the item and then another 50 to have it printed and framed yourself. |  | Turned out so good! Really worked with me too in finding out what I was looking for. Great communication and customer service. | I asked for some simple modifications to the original that they sent me, and the reply was a passive aggressive &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t do that. :) thanks!&quot;\n\nNot very pleased with this person&#39;s work. :( | Portrait was done in time for Xmas- would definitely order again in the future. Thank you! | Very happy with how the product turned out! | The portrait quality was amazing and was done quickly.  There was nothing more I could ask for.  Thank you. | Amazing picture it looks so cool | Alex did an amaazing job with my picture, i wanted it as a present for my bestfriend and he listened to any small detail that i wanted to add or adjust, he even draw the shadows of our bodies !

It&#39;s an anniversary gift for my husband :) It came out amazing! It is not easy to get them to fit together to look cozy in the game (for me to provide the picture) and it definitely wasn&#39;t easy to take the quality of that picture and make it into a real portrait. But Alex did it. And when there was a tiny issue with colors, he switched it immediately. 100% recommend! | Great feedback and timely responses. | Amazing service!!! Definitely recommendüëèüèΩ | This artist was extremely helpful! They kept me up to date on my order and answered any questions I had! | Alex was great at completing my order in a timely manner and keeping in touch with me throughout this process.

Highly recommend them, I‚Äôm so excited to offer my present! Thank you so much!! | Really great! Works with you happily, and takes in any changes you want to make - very patient!! | I loved the finale image.

The details where literally perfection. They draw you just like your picture totally worth buying here and I will definitely order more in the future. Hopefully one day they will have the option to sell physically the portrait ü•∫ü•∫. | Alex was super attentive and had a fast turnaround. The portrait was top quality. Highly recommend if you really want to impress someone. | Very happy with the quality and effort with my portrait!

I needed a portrait done quick for a funeral and he completed it in the time frame that I needed it in and helped me with the best way to print it, it‚Äôs beautiful exactly the way it‚Äôs described and the way I expected it to come out. Thank you so much..I highly recommend choosing him! | Excellent quick work and responsiveness to revisions. | Seller is extremely helpful! Loved how it turned out! | 100% recommend getting your custom portraits done at this shop! The artist was very easy to communicate with and very friendly. I requested a couple of tweaks from his first copy, and he was able to quickly make the adjustments. The final product came out perfect! He sent a digital copy, so I can print it easily at home in whatever size I need. I love it so much and am excited to give it to my boyfriend for Christmas! | Quality was wonderful, printed into a gorgeous photo. Super prompt. | Brilliant product and great service and communication. Second portrait and love both.

Simply amazing! | I loved the cartoon portrait that Alex created for me. It&#39;s a great way to add creativity to average photos.  His color selection was on point.  It was everything I wanted it to be. He had no issue expediting my portrait for our anniversary. My partner even waited too long to download the jpeg file and Alex was willing to send it back to us (in 24 hrs) a couple months later! At a fair price, this was money well spent and I will definitely chose this shop again. | It was very quick, and he was very nice and easy to work with! | Amazing!! Great shop to deal with | I was searching for a 5 pet portrait of my kitties for me and my partner for Christmas. I was given Alex who made a flawless and timeless art piece of my kitties in a timely matter. Immaculate detail in every pixel and he even helped fix the posture on one of my cats!

I‚Äôm a satisfied customer fo‚Äô sho‚Äô!! | The picture is more than I expected. This picture will definitely put a smile on my friends face considering she lost her husband in January. I appreciate you Alex and your GOD giving talent..Your the best..‚ù§Ô∏è | The portrait turned out great and they were very helpful in answering all my questions. | This was a gift for my son&#39;s birthday and it was his favorite!  He had me in tears, he loved it so much | The quality of the artwork was amazing! All of my requests and expectations were met! I requested a minor adjustment due to my own mistake, and it was taken care of quickly and wonderfully! Communication was awesome, and the item was completed in a timely fashion! Thank you so much! | The seller was very helpful in completing my drawing and was open to any comments I made regarding edits. He worked efficiently and got the drawing done in a quick fashion . I highly recommend! | My review times two...I liked it so much I got another one!  &quot;My portrait was really well done and the artist did make one little change for me with no drama or attitude. He made the whole process fun and communicated well. One hint, I went to the communicate with the owner area to say, how do I submit my photos, and guess what, that&#39;s where you can upload a photo, lol. Geez, what a forehead slap that was, silly me. I used Shutterfly and had mine put on their pieces of slate that come with stands, and it just popped! Thanks for the great idea to make this holiday more fun. &quot; | Great quality of finished portrait and Alex was really able to work with me well!! I really liked the image he produced from the three photos I sent. However, I had some requests to alter the photo slightly to make my dress pattern a bit closer to that in the photo. Alex was very accommodating in a short time frame. The portrait definitely met my expectations and Alex was nice to work with. It did match the description. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend Alex for this product and would be happy to try other items in his store if I have the need for them in the future. | In love with the results. I know this will make my whole family happy!! Alex was a pleasure and very helpful. I‚Äôll be ordering another one soon! | Thank you  - it turned out great! | My portrait was really well done and the artist did make one little change for me with no drama or attitude.

One hint, I went to the communicate with the owner area to say, how do I submit my photos, and guess what, that&#39;s where you can upload a photo, lol. Geez, what a forehead slap that was, silly me. I used Shutterfly and had mine put on their pieces of slate that come with stands, and it just popped! Thanks for the great idea to make this holiday more fun. | Alex was just brilliant! I asked for a portrait to be made from 4 individual pictures and he did it. It looks like the photo has been taken together! I was quite a picky customer asking for edits and changes but Alex met all of my needs to produce something really special. Definitely recommend if you want to create something special, Alex is a great artist with brilliant customer service! | I loved my requested portrait! Alex came up with a drawing super quick, I asked him to change one small thing and even that went fast. Certainly met my expectations! | A completely incredible experience.

The seller was fantastic to work with and listened to any revisions I had asked for! | This is the first purchase I have made from this shoppe and it will not be the last.  loved the finished product!  It was such a sweet gift for my husband on Valentine&#39;s Day.  Quality met expectations, shipping was fast. | Seller was very patient and professional.  I initially only provided 1 photo, but later realized it was worth it to provide more reference photos to get a better likeness (That&#39;s a hint for those of you planning to purchase a portrait).  Seller took my concerns into account from the beginning, and worked with me over several days, going through several drafts to get the results I wanted.  \n\nThe end result was basically exactly as I pictured; High quality and a near perfect likeness of us.  The only thing I noticed after the fact was that we had never discussed eye colors and the end result had just gray eyes for the both of us.  I&#39;m sure if I&#39;d brought it up again they would have fixed that for me as well, but that was something I could easily touch up myself.  No complaints. | Fast, responsive, accommodating.  Good purchase. | Alex did an amazing job on the portrait! üôåüèº I am giving this to my boyfriend for our anniversary and I know he‚Äôs going to love it, I will definitely be ordering more from Alex‚Äôs shop! | This was a birthday gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it! | Alex was great ! & I couldn‚Äôt stop thanking him. He created a picture of my friend who recently passed with her unborn. This was a perfect gift for my friends siblings & mom.  The timing was perfect and he followed all the instructions. He made sure I was satisfied with my order before emailing it. I would definitely recommend. You won‚Äôt regret. Thanks again Alex ü•∫ü¶ãüôèüèº | Alex is an awesome artist  and co- operative person.He made my portrait very well. He is very welcoming about the changes and suggestions. | Giving as a gift.  The image came out great! | My custom portrait came out beautiful! Alex was wonderful to work with--super responsive and very open to making the small changes I requested even after ordering. I printed the final product with ease and it will make the cutest Christmas present for my boyfriend! | My order was never completed and my messages went unanswered for weeks.  This seller does not do what you ask.  I have been dealing with this order for weeks and I do not need to work this hard to get something that I had to pay in advance for.  I finally had to ask for a refund.  I would NOT recommend this seller | This was exactly what I was looking for when I was looking for a Birthday gift for my wife. I used our first picture together 21 years ago. CPW was great to work with and very responsive to my questions. It turned out better than I was expecting. Will be using them again in the future. | Had an amazing experience, highly recommend | Alex did an amazing job on the photo.  I needed some updating on the size so it would layout properly when I printed to canvas and Alex was able to send over a few different sizes for reference.  We lined it up perfectly and it looks great.\n\nExcellent communication. Excellent speed. A++ Etsy seller! | It‚Äôs perfect! | Had a really great experience with Alex, he did such a good job! I asked if he could combine a picture of me and my partner with a picture of our dog and he did a fantastic job. The original picture of me and my partner had some small weird-nesses that Alex had no problem removing/fixing. I then just had the high resolution illustration printed locally on a canvas and it&#39;s perfect! Already recommended Alex to several of my family members and friends. | super fast, very friendly and it turned out exactly as expected! | Unfortunately, this was not a good experience. I was so excited to receive my cartoon photo. It was a gift for my bf&#39;s birthday and to celebrate him getting a new job, but the photo that came back was really off the mark. Didn&#39;t resemble the original much at all. A refund or some sort of satisfaction guarantee would be nice in these situations because now I essentially just threw money away. I ended up going with a different shop and they got things correct. Alex was very nice, though. | What a great gift this was. Loved the quality of the portrait and Alex was accommodating of the changes and adjusted colors as needed. Highly recommend. | ABSOLUTELY HAPPY WITH MY PICTURE! Fantastic job and he was patient while I needed some questions asked. Thank you! Will probably order again in the near futile ü§òüèΩü§òüèΩ | Alex was great to work with and the work was done very quickly. My son and daughter in-law loved their portrait.

Alex always replied back with quick responses and help. I would highly recommend this shop! | It was great üëç . The quality was good . | Alex went above and beyond to cater to my every question. He is extremely professional and prompt. I would highly recommend him :) | Worked with Custom Portraits World to create this farewell gift for someone leaving our company. It came out beautiful - and the recipient LOVED the artwork! We provided 3 images and a sketch of how we wanted the images combined.  From there, CustomPortraits sent a low res image back and we traded ideas/edits to bring the portrait to life.  CustomPortraits was incredibly professional, considerate and also helpful to work with.  We loved this image so much - that we went ahead and purchased a second a portrait.  One thing to call out, I found the &#39;drawing&#39; over the images to be done beautifully without looking cartoonish or anything. The images just looked beautiful, cohesive, light & fresh!! Would highly recommend working with CustomPortraitsWorld! | The portrait is soooo nice, could not have asked for better! Alex was very easy to deal with and he also made the modifications I asked super quickly. Will come back to him when I have other portrait to be done :) A+++++ | This exceeded my expectations. It was a very quick turnaround and Alex was great!!  Thank you. | Great gift. Turned out perfect. | Description could have been better that this is just artwork and not including any sort of deliverable besides a digital file. | Absolutely amazing work and a very kind and quick responding artist! | Great, wonderful  just order with time because it‚Äôs art work and he has to create it from scratch so it takes time. | The image came out better than expected. Loved it! | This turned out really awesome! Alex was fast and very professional. I had him do a few detailed edits and he was very accommodating and understanding.

I inquired about having that specific background on two separate emails. I was told it was a ‚Äúgood picture‚Äù. \nI make the purchase, I get the proof, and there is no detail in the background. I am then told (after I have paid) the background would be custom and would be an additional charge. \nI asked TWICE prior to the purchase, and it was never mentioned it would be an additional cost. Now I am $159 out for a picture that is drawn on white paper. \nI am not pleased, and I will not be returning to this seller‚Äôs shop. \nSave your money. | I gifted this to my boyfriend as an anniversary present and he absolutely loved it!

In the end, the product was great and as long as I have time to wait a few weeks for the product, I would order from them again. | Excellent product and service - the seller was obliging to make a small adjustment and return in a very reasonable timeframe. Love our picture ü•∞ | Second one and another satisfaction | Amazing art work done ! | I am thrilled with how this turned out!! Every detail is incredible! Any questions I had were answered in a super timely manner, and i couldn‚Äôt be happier with the end result! 10/10 would recommend! And I will definitely be coming back for more work done! | What a wonderful gift this will make.  Excellent end result.  We did make a few changes but that was zero problem and we are all so happy with the final product.  We will be back for additional gifts in the future. | Lovely! Such a beautiful job and quality.

It was easy to talk with Alex about any adaptations. He was really helpful. | Great quality! Exactly as described | The portrait turned out amazing!! Better than I could have imagined! Customer service was also great, I asked for some revisions and he did them without any problem! I would recommend Alex to anyone :) | Turned out amazing and adjusted what I wanted!! Thank you | I love it! He just didn&#39;t pay attention to detail. | So cute but a wrinkly baby! | I purchased a print for my best friends 21st birthday. We are incredibly close and I wanted the print to be perfect for her. I can comfortably say that I was not disappointed.\n\nDon‚Äôt think. Just buy.\nPhenomenal service, despite picky alterations that I wanted him to make. \nA lovely guy with excellent skills. | I love it! \nThank you! | This was a fantastic experience! The quality of work was superior, and the customer service was excellent. I wanted a family portrait done for our family of five (including pets). They were able to use five different photos of each family member to create the perfect picture! Also, the process was speedy! | Had no problem doing revisions. Understood what I wanted clearly and was very polite and professional. I love my drawing of my beautiful niece. It‚Äôs a present for my sister and brother in law. I know they will love it! üíï | Super cute work, exactly as advertised. | Fantastic experience and the art work is perfect | Top quality art and professional communication... SO easy to work with!\n\nThank you!! Will come back! | This was a wonderful purchase!

Would Recommend if you&#39;re trying to get a gift for spouse/soulmate :) | Picture came out very beautiful and it was exactly what my mom wanted for her boss. Process was easy and work was done in a timely manner.

Made the changes I wanted before finishing. | I didn&#39;t like how I looked in my picture and the seller wasn&#39;t real hip on giving me time to work with him to correct it. To be fair, he gave me a deadline to respond that I missed, but it was due to serious medical issues I was out of pocket for. Still, I won&#39;t purchase from this seller in the future. | Great work by Alex. I asked for several edits and he turned those around near immediately. Very cool art and would recommend! | I am so happy with the work they did for me !! it looks amazing! It is only a digital copy of the photo but i was able to get it framed ! | Alex is a great artist and I am very happy about the result of the portrait. It was a gift for my boyfriend and he also loves it! :) We printed the portrait and it has a special place in our living room. Our friends also make compliments about it. :-) The portrait was finished very fast by Alex and he changed a few things for me, even after a short period of time. He is very friendly and wants us customers to be happy with the result. I really recommend his work! :) | Great to work with, great results | My mother and I rate this shop with 5 stars.  From start to finish we were happy with our experience.  Alex was wonderful!  He was very helpful, turn around was quick and the quality of his work excellent.  Thank you so very much, Lisa and Nadine. | The service and quality of this was outstanding. I didn&#39;t expect the artist to be able to combine so many images to combine the essence of this photo. I loved it and will be back for more digital images. Thank-you! | Came out perfect. Would definitely recommend it ! | The artist went ABOVE and BEYOND on our picture.  He was wonderful to work with and did an incredible job.  The adults in the picture have all passed away and we wanted something for my FIL‚Äôs birthday with all the grandkids in it.  He and my MIL were speechless. We will definitely order more from this shop in the future. | Great customer service!! Alex sent over a rough draft of the portrait so i could review it and request any changes! I LOVE the final product and so does my boyfriend! Thank you so much! | It was a pleasure to work with Alex. My portrait came out great. The communication and customer service was wonderful. I had a few things I wanted fix and corrected and Alex did exactly what I asked for with no hesitation. I would definitely order another portrait from this shop again. | I just received my finished portrait from Alex and absolutely love it! \nThe photo quality I sent in wasn‚Äôt great but Alex did a fantastic job in replicating my image. \nI was given a preview of my portrait which was great but I wanted a couple of small changes made.

I will be booking again for future portraits :) | The portrait looks great! Very quick turnaround | I loved the portrait and how helpful the artist was in adding in details that I pictured in my head. It turned out amazing! | This was unbelievably good work! I showed the end result to my daughter and she said she could not remember taking the picture. This is because it never actually happened, but instead was two combined photos by the artist. Extremely talented and fine work! | Picture turned out great. Seller sent a rough draft of the image before the final product, and was VERY helpful with small edits I have. Really happy with the product :) | Stunning. Great communication. Definitely will order again!!! | Great service | I purchased this portrait as a gift.  I like that I was given a proof and the ability to test out a new background color and make modifications to a person&#39;s hair color.  The edits were made quickly and were exactly what I wanted!

Would definitely recommend! | I‚Äôm in love with my portrait! My fianc√© opened it on Father‚Äôs Day and his jaw dropped, he loves it! I only waited a few days and Alex was even nice enough to add a few extra details I asked for. It was easy to go to my local fed-ex and print it out myself for cheap. | Great work! I had 5 different pictures to be done. Some were of siblings that I had to send separate photos of. He was able to put them together in one picture. The likeness is incredible. Such a keepsake! | Fantastic customer service! | Great result I‚Äôd recommend. I bought a canvas through Easy Canvas Prints. | Love the portrait! Very well done. | Alex did an excellent job with the custom portrait! He was very easy to communicate with and made changes as requested.

Amazing quality!! | This portrait was beautiful. And the artist was responsive to the few suggestions I requested. I am purchasing this again for sure! | The portrait was better than expected.  It was a great representation of the photo. The portrait was ready for my review in 3 days.  It was a gift and the recipient absolutely loved it.  I will definitely  order for CustomsPortraitWorld again. | Purchased a customised portrait of myself & my fianc√©e for our anniversary and WOW it is absolutely amazing - she absolutely loved it!! Looks so nice in our home. I‚Äôve had lots of people saying how lovely it is & asking where I got it from :-) Thank you so much, really happy with it ü§ç x | Alex did an amazing job creating the portrait I envisioned.

Quick turnaround! Definitely will order again. | Where to start?  Alex is amazing!  The picture he designed was based off of a photo from 1983, so the quality was not amazing. But he did a FANTASTIC job. And he was very accommodating to a request for eye color update. I cannot wait to gift this to my sister this week.\n\nAlex - THANK YOU for helping me gift something unique and meaningful. ‚ù§Ô∏è | Superb job! I absolutely love my photo and could not ask for better. The photo I gave a as a reference was extremely detailed and the seller managed to incorporate details of my outfit and jewelry, which I did not even think was possible to see in the picture. Not only did they do what I needed to be done in the photo, they added additional details that made the photos look even more real! ABSOLUTELY in love and will be framing the photo! | Was looking for a gift for my friend and came across to Alex‚Äôs profile. Alex is so amazing! He is super talented and he is very detailed in his drawing! Thank you for delivering such a beautiful portrait! My friend love it! (: | Absolutely amazing! Had to make a few changes and seller was amazing and so helpful! Came out better than I could have imaged! | Alex definitely did a great job drawing my portrait! It was ready in a few days, it met my expectations and matched everything written in the description. My friends seriously loved the portrait and got lots of compliments!! Also it is super easy to contact the seller to make any adjustments regarding the portrait! Highly recommend:) | I have ordered products from Alex 3 times now and have been over the top in love with each piece! He is very quick to make any corrections and ultimately wants to ensure you love his work. Would 100% recommend him to anyone wanting a unique piece of art! | Alex is amazingly talented. He is quick to respond and will make sure you are happy with your edits. It is the cutest gift to anybody with pets or just friends/family. | The attention to detail is amazing! I truly value the qualify of the art. The custom portrait definitely exceeded my expectations, truly recommend. This has been my second time buying a custom portrait from Alex :) | Excellent work! This came out great and my girlfriend loves it! | I‚Äôll write a better review once I receive my item. I placed my order on January 28th. Alex was responding to me right away at first but haven‚Äôt heard anything in awhile. I been messaging him since yesterday and he hasn‚Äôt got back to me. I received an email yesterday saying my item was ready to be viewed but I didn‚Äôt receive anything. If you own your own business I would think you would respond to messages ASAP, that‚Äôs great customer service. I barely order anything on Etsy but I thought his portraits looked awesome and had great reviews so thought I‚Äôd purchase one. I really want to receive my portrait for Valentine‚Äôs Day because it‚Äôs for my boyfriend so I hope I get it soon. | Beautiful work! Can&#39;t wait to give it to my boyfriend for Valentine&#39;s Dayüíú | Thank you for being so quick with your work. I&#39;m really impressed by everything and can not wait to surprise her with it. | Alex did an outstanding job with my portrait!!! It looks exactly like my picture! He paid close attention to detail and added a few extra details himself like the shadows! He communicated with me the whole time and added a few other things to my portrait that I mentioned to him! I can‚Äôt wait to give this to my boyfriend for Valentine‚Äôs Day and I will definitely be purchasing more portraits in the near future! | My second order with this seller! Amazing picture, created it before the estimated date, very friendly and accommodating. | Great work and quick turn around! I am very happy with the result =) | These came out so beautifully!

Everyone loves it. Would recommend. | Such amazing work!! Thank you for recreating such a great memory for us. | The only reason I‚Äôm not giving a great review is because I did not end up liking the product (picture) the seller said I had up to 24 hours to respond to the picture he drew up, and it just made me look old.. and my hair color wasn‚Äôt the right color. I messaged him before the 24 hours and asked if I could please send in a different picture and he said no, but he‚Äôd at least change the hair color. Ended up not even getting it printed out. | Great service and really quick as well. Answered all my questions post delivery in a very polite and caring way. Highly recommended | The quality and craftsmanship is amazing and I&#39;m very happy with what they made me. However I wish it were more prominent that it was a digital portrait. I didn&#39;t realize until i had already paid and received my portrait. | Not worth it guy was nice though | I absolutely loved the portrait he made. He is very talented. His work is amazing. Provided him with some reference pictures and honestly it turned out better than what I expected. Will definitely be getting more in the future as this is a very original gift idea. | I loveeeeed it so much.. perfect gift! | adorable pic done of my daughter , love it !! | Beyond happy!!!! The quality of my portrait was outstanding and exceeded my expectations. He brought my vision to life. I 100% recommend working with this shop. I‚Äôve gotten several portraits in the past and this one is by far the best I‚Äôve ever come across! | This was fast and amazing!  I had a modification and this was easy and fast.  The seller was responsive and explained everything well.  I am considering ordering another.  So much fun to take a memory from a photo to a work of art.  Thanks so much Alex for your time and talent! | Amazing! It was perfect and exactly what I asked for. I wanted 2 different pictures put together because the grandma passed away before being able to meet the baby so getting them together in a pic was amazing. Thank you! | This shop knocks it out of the park everytime. I will be ordering again soon! | The portrait was absolutely amazing! Very fast and beautiful! All my questions and requests were fulfilled immediately. I really recommend! | The Seller EXCEEDED My Expectations.. I‚Äôm in Love üòçüòçüòç it‚Äôs A Gift For My Sister Birthday & She‚Äôs Gonna Be I‚Äôm Disbelief | Awesome!

I sent over several pictures as a reference and they delivered exactly what I was looking for. I will be coming back and I‚Äôll definitely recommend anyone to this shop. If you‚Äôre reading the reviews because you‚Äôre hesitant‚Ä¶ just order! Trust me you will not be disappointed. | Purchased this item at midnight, a few red wines deep and woke up feeling a little hesitant. Not only did they respond to me straight away but I was absolutely blown away by the print! I could not have asked for a better person to do this for me and the piece was so sentimental. 10/10 would recommend and have told everyone about it. | Not ready to review. We are still working on this. | My custom illustration came out so beautiful and very detailed! I was also impressed with the quick turnaround, especially given that it was during the holiday break (new years). I am definitely going to be ordering other illustrations-I think they&#39;ll make great gifts! | Love my picture, can‚Äôt wait to print it out. | Well done! Alex was super accommodating and patient with me to get my picture just right. This is a gift for a friend and I‚Äôm excited for her to receive it! I will most likely be ordering another one soon. | Alex was a delight to work with and the finished product is high quality. Quick turnaround, easy to download, and print however you want.

I&#39;m so excited for my friends to view the portrait arts. Thank you so much for the dedication on making sure the artwork looks perfect~ | Great communication from seller and made sure the product was what I wanted by offering to make any changes.

Designer was very professional, very nice and quick! | The picture was way better than I expected!! The detail may amazing!! Such a great job!  Will be back for more pictures! | The custom portraits I commissioned far exceeded my expectations. i didn&#39;t have photos with my fur babies and one of them had passed on before I got the other two so it was not an easy portrait to do, therefore it took some time. if you are in a hurry, do ask when you will expect to receive it, otherwise as I believe it is best not to rush the artist as anyone in the creative field do their best work when inspired. Alex was very communicative, he understood perfectly what I wanted and made tiny adjustments when requested. this is a collaborative work, it will be best to tell him what you want before hand, character, unusual highlights, expression, anything to look out for, what you wish to portray . I love the work Alex did and he is indeed very talented. I can see why he&#39;s a big success on Etsy. | Alex was so amazing and so helpful when it came to me getting my order. He continuously kept me updated and I will be buying from him again in the near future! | Alex was very friendly and quick to reply to the initial message and got the end product to me quickly. The artwork was amazing and exceeded my expectations! It made a great gift for my friend and she and her family loved it! | I wanted to gift something to my nephew, so I had this digital drawing created and the quality of the drawing/file was amazing, so I had it made into a canvas (different site).  The print was fantastic.  Highly recommend this shop, as it made my nephew so happy.  Can‚Äôt thank you enough!!! | I got it for my sister bridal shower and she loved it !! | Amazing customer service! | Alex was amazing and professional! He responded quickly with a near perfect portrait, and was super amenable and fast in editing the one request I had. The portrait is top quality, and I highly recommend Alex and his shop! I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll order another at some point. Thanks so much, Alex! | The end result turned out beautiful. It was completed on time and the service was great. I highly recommend! They make wonderful gifts. | We are so happy with our order! I work for a scrap metal recycling company, and the drawing we received will be going on the side of one of our trucks. Highly recommend ordering from this shop! | I love the result of this. Alex was very responsive, and honestly finished the product very quickly. It looks great and absolutely met my expectations.

Seller was amazing and flexible with design adjustments | Very easy to work with and quick turn around time.

I bought it as a birthday gift for my mom. It‚Äôs definitely a great way to share a memory. The seller was great with communication and was very helpful when I reached out for some changes. The whole process was quick. Very happy! | This man is a real artist! Really happy with the result of my drawing. I asked him for a few detailes and he did this with a great result.

I&#39;m impressed with the attention to detail, quality, and turnaround of the file. I absolutely recommend this shop for its digital art. Thank you again, Alex!! | Working with this shop has been an absolute pleasure and I cannot express how happy I am with this product. I ordered it for my parents anniversary and worked with the artist to get it perfect down to the smallest detail. Cannot recommend enough!! | Alex did an AMAZING job! He made something that is so sentimental to myself and my fianc√© and we‚Äôre so appreciative. He was great to work with! | Thank you for your availability and the delivery time.\nI really like the illustration. | great to work with with | My order came out great! | Shop was very easy to work with, sent me a preview of what it would look like before sending the final files. Amazing work and a great gift | I wish I had the same experience as everyone else. Lack of communication. Smh | I NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER! I believe his reviews are fake. I did not receive the same experience as these so called reviews. I‚Äôve been messaging this seller for days and he only responded once to tell me my order is in progress and asked me to confirm how I wanted my photo. If my photo was in progress, why would he ask me to confirm what I wanted if he already started the order. That was three days ago. This is a SCAM. Do not buy from this seller. I‚Äôm still waiting for my order and it‚Äôs been 11 days when the listing says 3-5 day turnaround time. I would never order from this company again. (Photos attached for proof) \n\nUpdate: He write back to tell me because I gave him a bad review, he‚Äôs not giving me a refund. This man is a fraud! He takes your money and doesn‚Äôt care. Don‚Äôt believe in these good reviews. They‚Äôre no real! | I NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER! I believe his reviews are fake. I did not receive the same experience as these so called reviews. I‚Äôve been messaging this seller for days and he only responded once to tell me my order is in progress and asked me to confirm how I wanted my photo.

Recommend his work for you and your loved ones | Fast service, great portrait. Would highly recommend! | Exactly as described. Quick and great quality. Thanks! | Beautiful | I loved it! This was an amazing gift, communication was very easy, I definitely recommend! | this was a great gift. Alex was good with communicating and turn around time was good! | Great quality, excellent communication throughout. Love the end result. Such care was taken with the things that were important to me and there were revisions so it could be just right - which it is! I have already planned my next portrait to have done! | It was great ! So helpful and good work in the end . My expectations were met .\nThank you . | Excellent service! Alex is very knowledgeable and talented artist. I‚Äôm very happy of our portraits outcome. I ask for adjustments after the first draft, Alex didn‚Äôt hesitate to make changes. He send it back in fast turn around time. The price is super reasonable for the amount of work, time, and effort put in. Love it very much‚Ä¶recommend to everyone looking for any gifts for any occasion. Thanks Alex! | My expectations were greatly exceeded. Great communication when I was unable to locate my files through fault of my own. The couple whom I gifted the picture too were blown away. | Spectacular!! Loved the image created. My father in law passed suddenly without getting to meet his grandson and Alex was more than able to create an image of them together. Thank you! | Amazing! Turned out even better than I had hoped. Sent multiple pics that were combined into one portrait. It was done way faster than expected. He even made a change to it that I requested after he was done. Loveeee it!!! | great job with this; very responsive on a touch-up | I cannot believe how amazing this portrait came out! It was better than expected. I have ordered another one already because I loved the first one so much. | The portrait was a wonderful Mother&#39;s Day present of our two kids.  Alex with Custom Portraits was awesome to work with.  Wanted feedback on what was wanted.  A very customer based process.  Very nice job...thank you! | I absolutely love my portrait. The seller sent me a draft of the portrait and and asked me if I wanted to make any changes before sending the final image. The final product came out amazing and I even received it sooner that expected. I definitely recommend using this seller. The portrait makes a great gift for anyone! | Awesome job! Would purchase again | I am very pleased with the work that Alex did! I have went to many artists and asked them to make an illustration for me and I&#39;ve never been happy with it so I found Alex and I was very very pleased with his work, the detail and the accuracy is phenomenal I would highly recommend Alex to anyone wanting a custom-made portrait, he does an amazing job.  I asked him to turn a old picture of my mum and her parents when she was a little girl into a more recent picture of her becuase her parents are dead now and he did a amazing job making it look real and aging everyone making them still look like themselves. There were some things I asked fix and he fixed it and made it look so much better I will definitely be coming back in the future. He did what I thought was impossible I never imagined the portrait would look this good üëèüëèüëè | so cute, was really easy to communicate exactly what i wanted | Truly Amazing art work! Thank you so much | Alex was very responsive and easy to work with. Made some modifications as requested that deviated from the original photo.  Super impressed! | Thankyou Alex, love the portrait :) | Exactly what I wanted! It took him about a day to respond to each of my text which made me a bit worried that I wasn‚Äôt going to get my picture on time but he was able to give me the final a day after Etsy said I‚Äôd ‚Äúreceive‚Äù it. \n\nAlso I have him three different pictures and he was able to combine them so well | Alex is incredible- he created the most perfect image and was so open to making adjustments.

Already recommended to a friend since she loved the result so much :) | I ordered 2 prints as a thank you gift and they were perfect.

Girlfriend loves it :) | Very helpful and accommodating! Makes sure to get your portrait perfect! Love ours so much | I have ordered from Alex twice and both times he was able to recreate portraits that my family cherishes. Both orders were of my grandparents who sadly passed away over the last 2 years and I have gifted the pictures to my mother and sister. All three of us have the pictures on display which means so much to us! Alex was able to create in a very timely manner. He is also very polite and responsive which was so refreshing, especially since I am grieving the loss of 2 very important people in my life. | Loved the first so much, I ordered another. Very accommodating and quick turn around. Beautiful finished product. | The drawing turned out beautifully! My boyfriend loved it for valentine‚Äôs day. | It looks amazing, thank you!! | Absolutely great to work with and would definitely order from again.

I asked for a drawing of my husband at our wedding with his grandpa who passed away prior to the event. I didn&#39;t know how it would look since there wasn&#39;t any picture of them together, but it turned out amazing! Thank you so much! | I&#39;m satisfied of the portrait that Alex has made for the father&#39;s day. He was very attentive to my requests and he made all the changes I wanted. The final result is perfect. Thank you for the work. | Alex was helpful and tried to make things right with 3 revisions.  Unfortunately, I am still displeased with the likeness of my partner in the portrait itself.  Not what I was expecting or hoping for. | Very excellent but little too expensive. | This was an amazing purchase.  I didnt need customer service but I did communicate with the seller about the cropping of the picture.  He was a pleasure to deal with.   The final print came out better then expected | Absolutely adorable!!!!

The process went very smoothly and any alterations that I requested were handled very quickly and without hassle. I had also changed my mind about the background color, and this could be changed without any problem - that was really nice and made me love the final result even more. Thanks! | Alex was so responsive, made some edits to my drawings and of all of the three designers I used on etsy, he captured the facial features and figures most accurately. 100% recommend!!! | Turned out better than I hoped! I received it quickly too. | I am always pleased with the vectorized portraits that Alex does.  The work is done well and the delivery is timely.

This was my first order on Etsy and I was not an ideal customer, but Alex was always very quick and did great work as he responded to my requests.

Will definitely order again in the future. | wasn&quot;y happy. dont accept sorry im busy | I contacted the seller with questions and specifications about my order BEFORE buying to ensure he would deliver per request. Seller confirmed he could create the portrait I requested. I gave him specific instructions before and after the purchase. Once he delivered the portrait for review, it did NOT include the specifications requested. On top of that, he sent it to me for review after I asked about it. It was late. It took a lot of repeating myself and it was 1 week late. I had to change my plans for when I was going to give the portrait as a gift. It didn&#39;t even get to me on time for Valentine&#39;s day. Took him about 1 day to answer messages even though we are in the same country! Portrait came out ok, but after repeating why it did not match the picture. Not sure why he couldn&#39;t see and compare himself. Frustrating! | I received my portrait and I am satisfied with the result. Alex is very attentive and he makes the requested changes. I recommend! | Looks absolutely perfect and shipped quickly! Thank you! | I really loved this portrait! It was also created so quickly, I was very impressed. | 100% would recommend! | Amazing ü§© my husband loved it so much ! | Design came out great - he worked with me to adjust the image to soften it. Great service and product. | This portrait is stunning... the artist was amazing to work with too. My partner and I are so happy with our purchase!!!! Will 100% use again! | I am absolutely amazed at this work. I got these photos made for a family member who lost their mom and after a few critiques, because I can be difficult sometimes, Alex was able to still assist me and fulfill all of my needs. Needless to say the photos came out AWESOME, and I‚Äôd DEFF recommend. So pleased! | My boyfriend loved the illustrated picture of us I gave him for our first anniversary! ‚ù§Ô∏è | Love the Portrait Amazing Work!","Buyers report that the seller is talented, quick to respond, provides great customer service, is helpful and accommodating, and is willing to make changes to the portrait to meet expectations; buyers also mention that the portraits are high quality, beautiful, amazing, and make great gifts."

Perfect and just like the photo! Christmas gift for a friend&#39;s whose 4-year-old has a space themed bedroom! | Shop easy to work with - pillow is very cute and well made. | Be very careful when opening the item. There is no box.

I love it! | diane on Oct 21, 2024\n\n5 out of 5 stars    \nI looked at many shops before picking this one. I am so glad I did! I ordered 5 pillows for my grandchildren and grandnieces. The quality is amazing and I have no doubt the children will cherish these pillows. I contacted Dogan several times with questions and requests and he each time his response was almost immediate (even with the time difference!) He helped me design pillows that fit each child perfectly. It was a delight to work with him. He has a lot of patience and great experience to guide me through the process. I highly recommend this shop and will definitely be using him again. Thank you, thank you! | Wonderful! Beautiful work, great communication. Thank you! | My son loves this pillow! We get lots of compliments on it. The quality is pretty decent but one of the corner pom pom tassels fell off within a few days. | My son loves the pillow. | Great job!

The seller was amazing at communicating and customizing my item and the quality of the pillowcase is amazing ! | Super cute for my themed nursery! | The item is very well made, and the customer service was great.

713523939,"Love this mold. Will definitely buy again from this store. | Great mold, very pretty.

Yet to use but the delivery was prompt. | So cute.Exactly as described.Love this mold will definitly be buying more from this supplier. | My order was supposed to be delivered to me by early March I just received today (JUNE 3rd)  I already had ordered my product elsewhere! But because of shipping ‚Äúproblems‚Äù I can no longer return my order from Feb.  just keep that in mind when ordering from this seller | I love this mold BUT I have to warn people:  it is EXTREMELY HARD TO REMOVE the soap from the mold.  This mold is on the thin side so there is no way to cut slits in the mold for easier soap removal without ruining the mold.  Literally you have to fight for a few minutes with the mold every single time you want to un-mold the soap.  This particular design needs to be set in a much thicker wall silicone mold so slits can be cut and rubber bands used.    Other than that I absolutely love the design. | Can‚Äôt wait to use thank you again!! | As expected. Tysm. Can‚Äôt wait to use it. | I seriously wish I never bought from them. It&#39;s just been a huge huge hassle and I feel like I was scammed. | Came from aliexpress ¬ø? | Just like the picture ! | Absolutely gorgeous!! Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better mold! | Mold is perfect and it got here faster than I expected! | I was not able to use it because the petals broke each time when removing my candle wax from the mold. I tried 10 different times, letting them sit for different times, including cutting my slits for easy removal but still the petals broke. Would probably work great with paraffin wax or resin but not soy wax. =/ | Amazing product üíû the quality is wonderful, and customer service is so great!

Packaging is nice with clear instructions.  Not just in a small zip like some companies.  Highly recommend SeedGeeks for all your garden needs. | Love the seeds I buy from them often and they always produce well | Bought $50 of seeds and over half of the varieties never germinated. Very disappointing. | Seeds germinated and within days of planting! very happy!! I will be ordering from here again.","Many buyers mention fast shipping, well-packaged items, and good germination rates; some buyers are excited to plant the seeds and are looking forward to the harvest, while others appreciate the informative packaging and planting instructions; however, some buyers report issues with delayed shipping, lack of communication from the seller, and seeds not germinating."
1343370475,"Perfect earrings, just as pictured! They made for a great Christmas gift. | LOVE these earrings, they&#39;re so unique and fun!! | Pretty earrings, nice quality and fast shipping. I knocked off one star because they need a stopper on the back because they fall out of my ears easily. | Great! Very unique styles! Thanks. | They look like great earrings to have and I‚Äôm excited to be able to wear them. It just took forever to get here. However, the seller was good at reaching out as well as getting updates and such. | Seller handled shipping problem and sent replacement. It was seamless, convenient and the quality of the earrings is incredible!! | Very pretty earrings I love the matte texture and shape of the hoops. Thanks again. | A very nice pair of earrings. | Wore these to an event and kept getting compliments.  Customer service is great - kept updating me on the status of my purchases. | I ordered this for an event that I was hosting, I placed the order a MONTH before the event. At the end it didn‚Äôt come until 3 days after my event, completely loosing the point of buying this. It didn‚Äôt come with back stoppers, and the ‚Äúhook‚Äù part is so small, it kept falling out and dropping onto the floor. Even if I just lightly shake my head, it falls out | Unfortunately the ‚Äústud‚Äù part of this earring is much thicker than average and did not fit in my earring hole (this has never been an issue before). Otherwise, great customer service and was given a free gift with purchase. | The earrings are exactly what I wanted.  The shipping was delayed and it took over 2 weeks to arrive. However,the quality of the ear rings was worth the long wait. | LOVE them! üíï can‚Äôt wait to wear them! | I love my new earrings! They&#39;re even more beautiful than in the picture! | They need larger backs to hoops hard to do tiny ones | Nice, the wire is a little thick if you are used to wearing wire earring | Beautiful earrings. I recommend them | Beautiful and elegant earrings. Great customer service!! | they‚Äôre so pretty, BUT the part that goes in my lobe is too thick. maybe a gauge too big. | The item didn&#39;t look as nice as the picture. Definitely cheaper looking in person. | Great product. Got many compliments | Please see previous review with picture | These earrings are as described. Just the right size. Great communication with seller | Beautiful!! Great weight. We&#39;ll made. | I was expecting these to be lighter than they are.  They are pretty and easy to put on.  I had no problem with them falling out as other buyers did. | Nice earring. A lot bigger than expected since there was no size in description. | I haven‚Äôt worn them because  they‚Äôre way bigger than I thought they would be. Are those tiny plastic pieces supposed to hold them on? | These are funky and fun! | The earrings are exactly what I wanted and very nicely made. Thank you! | Love them and will wear them often. | Absolutely gorgeous, a very professional, classy statement piece | Great quality and they look the same as described. Shipping took a while. | PERFECT!!! Thank you so much!!! | Very nice customer service . | Great product and service thank you | Much larger earrings than I expected. These will look stunning on my daughter. | Took a long time to ship. The pair seems less unique in person, highly manufactured | Beautiful!! I gave this as a gift and she absolutely loved it!","Buyers describe the earrings as beautiful, pretty, unique, and great quality, though some found the earrings larger than expected or the earring posts too thick, and some had issues with the earrings falling out due to small or missing stoppers; some buyers experienced delayed shipping, but appreciated the great customer service and communication from the seller."
1749675182,,"The bracelets are described as cute, pretty, dainty, delicate, colorful, and well-made, with good quality metal; some buyers found the bracelet smaller than expected, and some experienced issues with the bracelet breaking or the clasp being too small, while others noted longer than expected shipping times from Turkey, but appreciated the customer service."
891310113,"Works great! Easy to use and clean. Perfect for potty training while out and about. | Owner was awesome in working with me to get this item shipped to Canada with different options. \n\nUsed it once so far and it does work in blocking the toilet sensors. Son is still scared of public bathrooms and I‚Äôm hoping this will help him get use to them. | Great product and fast shipping! | The seller was fantastic helping me to track my order and making sure I got it. Love the product and shop. | Came quickly and was exactly what I expected it to be | My daughter was scared to use the bathroom at school because she was worried it would automatically flush while she was still going. Thank you so much for this life saver! She is now happy and confident with this product! As an educator, this is also a life saver for students that dislike loud noises like the toilet automatically flushing. Great idea with this! :) | Perfect for my potty training toddler who is scared of public toilets! | Item is as described and looking forward to using it | I loved the packaging! It felt very personal with a hand written note. Thank you for making my life easier with the flusher blocker! | The product arrived on time and looks/works great! | Innovative product, thoughtful packaging, clear instructions, bonus gift. üíó | Best invention ever!!!! I intend to buy a few more to have some backups. Worked perfectly for my toddler who was so distracted by the public potty flushing!!!!!! He can now go in public. YAY | Slightly smaller then expected. | Better than expected and order was accompanied by a sweet note! Definitely recommend. | Works great! Daughter feels more comfortable using the public restroom thanks to this. | I want to say thank you for having these available. I bought one last year for my trip to DisneyWorld and was finally able to use an automatic toilet after 20 years of avoiding them due to sensory issues. You made my trip so much easier and a little less stressful. I bought a backup this year just in case something happened to the one I have or I end up losing it because it‚Äôs now a necessity to have with me when I‚Äôm in public. I plan on buying another to put on my keys in the near feature. You are amazing and thank you once again so much. | When placing my order I accidentally selected more than one design choice for only 1 item. The seller quickly messaged me asking which choice I meant. Very polite! I just received the package today and pleasantly surprised that it came with a lovely hand written letter, sticker and complete information list on how to use the product. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone struggling with potty training while on the go or with children who have very high sensitivity to noises or fear of animatronic things like my child. | I got this for my niece she won‚Äôt use auto flush toilets they‚Äôre too loud I‚Äôm excited for her to be able to use them | Such great quality and has helped tremendously! Description was accurate. | Great product, great seller, will continue to order as gifts. | Using this as an accom. for a special education student who is anxious about the sensor on the toilet. They love it! | Excellent product.  I no longer need to make sure I have sticky notes in every purse.  I just keep this in my wallet.  Given that I carry alcohol spray to disinfect my hands while out, this set up works out perfectly.  I just spray the cover after using it, and am good to go.  This is an excellent idea.  They really should carry this at the stores - but I know it may spark a controversy from insensitive people and, of course, the toilet industry. | Life changing for any mama who‚Äôs child is afraid to use the potty with an automatic flusher! This is pure genius!! Thank you!!! | Where was this on my last trip with my kids... I bought it for my daughter to take to kindergarten this year, since she is scared of automatic toilets | This is a great item we use for my kiddo when going to the public bathrooms. Easy to carry and clean up etc. Nice options for patterns but I would say that it is a bit finicky to keep and carry with you without that chain and then with it, you have to remove it before using it, etc. I wish I could find a tiny envelope or something . | Works like a charm to prevent unwanted flushes! | As someone with autism who can&#39;t stand automatic toilets, this product was a huge life saver for me going out in public! | Hi ,\n\nIt was a great idea to come up with this. It has been helpful for our highly sensitive child who always refused to use  autoflush. She has used it couple times since we have used the pads. I would highly recommend the product to any kid struggling to use the noisy auto flush potty . I would have given it 5 star if they were reusable . I think they are single time use covers. \n\nThanks","The product is easy to use and clean, works great, and is helpful for children who are scared of public toilets or automatic flushers due to sensitivity or anxiety, with buyers appreciating the fast shipping and thoughtful packaging, including a handwritten note; buyers also mentioned the product helped them or their children use public restrooms without fear of the loud flushing."

The description said about 6 inches tall, but it was actually 5 inches tall,  I still love it, but wish they would make  some taller terra cotta planters with scalloped rims, and possibly with stem base  (I used to have one like that but lost it when moving).

I‚Äôve already went back and ordered more! I found my go to place! | Shipment took a few weeks, which is understandable since the item needs to be made. When I reached out to get an update, response was quick and item shipped out on date they updated me with. Customer service was exceptional. Once the item was shipped, delivery was quick. Nicely packaged. The item itself is really well made! I purchased the chinchilla corner ledge. Nice thick, smooth wood. As soon as I installed it, our chins started playing in it.

He loves it and is now sleeping in it! He jumps, crawls, and nibbles all over it! | Wow! Amazing tunnel! Beautifully made! Took a while  but was worth it. My chin  boys are very happy Overall very pleased with this product! Thank you so much!!! | Very well made tunnel. Big enough for two. My chins were nervous about it at first. After a few days, they are comfortably sleeping in it together! | I wanted a &quot;house&quot; for my Chinchilla that would be off the floor of his cage and this worked perfectly.  In hindsight, I should have sent measurements as it was too big to fit in the door and the bolts were just a smidge off for the cage wires, but we got it to work. Well constructed and quick delivery. | Spacious and beautifully crafted. It was a lot bigger than I expected. My chinchilla loves it. It‚Äôs his favorite hiding spot. | Perfect for my chunky chinchilla! He loves sleeping in this, and gives him a bit to chew on! Shipped fast and is wonderfully crafted!

They were also larger than expected which was not a bad thing although I did have to rethink the setup of my chin&#39;s cage. | Both of my chinchillas LOVE this house, at least one of them is always in to or on it. When it arrived, it looked way too big and heavy and I couldn‚Äôt imagine it would attach sturdily enough (the Critter Nation cage bars are a bit weak) with only having bolts on one side. I was wrong and it‚Äôs perfect. Sturdy and a great size. They both fit comfortably even if they want to stretch out. It could even fit a 3rd relatively comfortably.

Delivery to a bit but it was worth the wait! | My chinchilla loves his new corner hiding box! It is very solid and sturdy. Beautifully constructed and fits perfectly in the cage. | Took quite a bit of time to arrive, but very nice product! Definitely more than big enough for my 2 adult chinnies | I love this and my bird does too! I wanted to give her a play space that felt cozy but that wasn&#39;t dark (because that can trigger nesting behavior). This is perfect because it lets in light. It&#39;s the perfect size too. She loves playing in it!","Buyers report that the products are well-made, sturdy, and larger than expected, with a wood smell; many buyers mention their chinchillas loving the product, using it as a hiding spot, and that it is big enough for multiple chinchillas; some buyers mention that shipping took a while, but the product was worth the wait."

The customer service was second to non!! Will definitely buy from again!! | The dice shipped quickly and were packaged very well! Also, the seller was very nice and kept me informed about the shipping progress. For the most part, I am happy with the dice. However, I am very picky about my dice, and a few quality issues stand out to me. First, some of the stars don&#39;t look like stars (you can kind of see it in the picture next to the 6). Second, some of the inking on the numbers was poorly done (like the 3 in the picture). Next, the d8 was missing a couple of points. Finally, there were some markings on my d4 that I wasn&#39;t able to capture in photos. I believe most of these issues could be solved by a new dice mold, so hopefully the creator will replace it soon. However, I can fix most of this myself so I&#39;m not upset. | My husband absolutely loved the dice! | The dice arrived quickly and look great! | Amazing quality! These were a present and he loves them! Shipped fast when they were ready - thanks so much! | Great dice! The service was amazing; the owner saw I placed the order right before the holidays and made sure I knew there were ready-to-ship options as well in case I needed them for a gift.

527305557,"I don&#39;t even know what to say about how incredibly perfect this item is. It is beautifully well made, and was SO worth the wait. After the expected shipping TAT passed I reached out to the seller to see when I might expect the case--I order items frequently from etsy and understand that a lot of people who share their creations also have day jobs, so missing a shipping TAT isn&#39;t a big deal for me. \n\nI received a quick reply and an explanation that blew my mind--they were shipping all their packages to family in Miami to then ship out from there, due to the postal service shutdown in Guatemala. Talk about dedication! Not only was this already in my mailbox the day after I had emailed the seller, but I was truly impressed and excited for the case. 150% recommend.  | Beautifully designed and put together. | Product was in fair condition upon arrival, not as sleek as pictures, one might think that the creator is tired of making this product, and quality has taken a hit for it. Upon arrival my belt buckle was bent, and the white liner was beginning to pull apart straight out of the box. While I was slightly upset, I decided to contact the store before leaving a negative review; I figured this may be a common problem, and maybe they could offer an easy solution, however, the shop owner did not seem to care at all about the quality of my product. I understand that they may have thought I was fishing for a refund, but that was not the case, Careful if you decide to order this product, it‚Äôs liable to ship with errors that can snowball into your case being destroyed. | Lovely quality, friend was very happy with his gift.\nTakes a little while (but it&#39;s been well made and come a long way!) So very happy &pleased üôÇ | This was a very well-made piece!  | Lovely product tbh. Highly recommended.  | It‚Äôs awesome!!! He loved it!!! | It&#39;s great! As advertised, not very protective for a serious drop, but good if you have a back back or something this is a snazzy way to add some protection from the rest of the junk in there. | A must for any BOTW fan! | After a few weeks of use, I can attest that this case protects my Switch well and is easy to carry around.  The design is creative and executed well.  I appreciate that the tunic design is embroidered, not printed, and the brown straps make the design so fun!  The crafsmanship is superb in all but one regard:\n\nThe magnetic clasps (there is one on the left and right of the closing flap) don&#39;t line up properly to close.  The female halves of the clasps are set too far towards the middle so that I have to bend the flap to bulge outward in order to close the case.  The case still functions as intended, but it annoys me just enough to try to fix it myself.\n\nDespite the one issue, I still recommend this product and this seller!  Everything looks nice, is sturdily made, and functions as intended. | Really high quality. It&#39;s a tight fit for the switch but I feel like that adds to the cushioning and protection. | Gorgeous and very well made!! | Exactly what I expected! Shipping took a while but that was communicated well! Even comes with an insert for added padding and games. | Great case, looks fantastic and is a much better design than any other case I‚Äôve found at this price.  | Fits my Switch perfectly and makes it easy to take my Switch with me and I can place a few games in it with me. This is one of my most favorite patterns! | Great item with fab quality | Very well made. I loved the stitching. Definetly worth it, and deffinetly an upgrade from the case I used to carry it in. I would carry it in a hard rubber case in my back-pack, so this item really cleared up space. I&#39;d recommend the item if you intend to carry your switch in your back-pack or in a bag | This is the second item I bought from this seller and when I say they make amazing things THEY DO! The quality is just incredible. I gave this as a gift to my brother and he loved it. Will definitely purchase again and highly recommend. | The detail is gorgeous and the craftsmanship is very sturdy. The Switch fits snug inside with plenty of padding to keep it protected. You can store up to six game cartridges and the elastic cover them competely with no chance of them slipping out.  Honestly the contruction of this bag is so nice I will be ordering another style in the future. | Item is good quality and arrived quickly. Brilliant.  | Great case! Very well designed. Love it. | This item was beautifully made and is exactly as described. The craftmanship is very high quality and the gift recipient loved this! Thank you so much! | Great quality! Love it! | Shipping was extremely fast once the item was finally shipped. The design is awesome and the quality is great!  | Made just how I wanted it. | Looks amazing and I&#39;m wondering I didn&#39;t get one earlier | Item is as good as advertised, pleased with the final result. | This is extremely high quality and was delivered in great condition. Supplier was upfront about possible delays in shipping, and it came earlier than anticipated. Highly recommended. | Amazing quality and extremely useful. Did not regret this purchase at all! | This is so cool looking. | The case looks exactly like the picture. Quality is fantastic. The seams are all neat and nothing is frayed. It is the perfect size for holding the switch and has several small pockets for games. A great fan for any Zelda fan who likes to take their Switch off the dock to play. | Item arrived ahead of schedule. Great quality, looks just like the photos. Would definitely recommend üëç | Love this case. It‚Äôs nice and slim but still offers a good bit of padding over the screen area. As others noted it‚Äôs a little tight at first - not so much in getting the switch in the case, but more so getting th flap to fold over the front. But I expect that to wear in to a perfect slim-fitting case that‚Äôs also stylish. Highly recommend! | Very high quality in the craftsmanship and the material | Fantastic, same as my order before. This is actually my second time ordering this particular case as my sibling suPER loved it when mine came, so it was an easy birthday gift choice. It matches the switch bag he already owns quite nicely, so I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be thrilled. | This has been my favorite purchase from Etsy ever! You can just feel the triforce power flowing through the tunic! LOL! But seriously the quality for the price! it was worth every penny! The minute I saw it I was like: &quot;Shut up and take my money!&quot; | I LOVE the case!! My brother was definitely super jealous. Great material, the padding seems really good quality. Can&#39;t wait to use it! | excellent switch case... holds the system with joycons attached...games are very secure in their individual slots....the craftsmanship is amazing...this case should cost twice what it&#39;s selling for | Absolutely love it!! I wish I could take more pictures one really doesn‚Äôt do it justly. Definitely worth the wait and I can‚Äôt wait to buy a case for my ds as well \n!! | Perfect case for anyone who loves Breath of the Wild. | This is a well made item and was exactly what I wanted. Sometimes fan made products don&#39;t live up to how the picture looks, but I&#39;m extremely happy with how this came out. It works well and looks stylish. | Shipped much earlier than I expected! When I opened the package, I was blown away by the quality of the case, the case looks much better in person because photos don&#39;t do it justice! Thanks :) | Really great quality for a great price. I&#39;m happy with my purchase. Really nice durable case. | Very well made and looks amazing! | Well made. Matches description. I&#39;m happy with it. | Case is very cute and light. Has space for 6 games. | It‚Äôs exactly as described! | my order came very quickly from the shipping announcement. the case seems really well made from a first impression, it fits my switch lite, several games and my charging cable. i have a cover on my switch that causes it to bulk up some, and it is a bit difficult to close the case because of this, but not impossible. i would have liked a wrist strap or some keychain rings, but so far it‚Äôs great! | Another wonderful quality case from this wonderful shop :) | Wonderful quality. By far my favorite holder for the switch. Great communication with seller. | Way better/unique than any other case you can get on Amazon.  The magnets are placed a little weird so closing the case isn&#39;t as seamless as other products I&#39;ve used with magnets but it&#39;s not a big problem. | It‚Äôs great quality, looks amazing and does its job as a Switch case!\n\nDelivery took a long time due to international shipping but that was made clear ahead of time. | This is our second one from this shop! We liked our first one so much that we got a matching case. It&#39;s so well made and so cute. Love the Champion&#39;s Tunic motif! | Great case! Well worth it. | Love this case! Very well made, fits the switch perfectly, and has a great amount of padding. Looking forward to having this with me on my travels! | Absolutely stunning, and highly recommended for Breath of the Wild fans. I live all the way across the ocean, so it took a while to get here, but I&#39;m very satisfied with my purchase. Will probably order again soon! The quality is amazing. | Beautifully made and is a definite step up on cushioning and protecting the Nintendo Switch. A+++ | I love it! Exactly what I wanted. | Ignore the bad photo quality, this item is pretty good quality. There really is a lot of padding, more than I expected. With the switch inside, it can get pretty thick. Feels secure and looks good to boot. Delivery was pretty good even to Asia. Thanks for the good quality hand made product! | Reached out asking about different designs and I got one apon request! Fabric is super soft and design is super bold I absolutely love it and have gotten several compliments on it so far! I adore it so much! | This thing looks super dope and the padding gives significant protection. Love it! | This case is beautiful, high quality, and it arrived quickly! | Very pleased with the quality case. A nice snug fit for my Switch and awesome design. | Great quality, only minor complaint is it fits the switch a little too snuggly so it can be a bit hard to get in particularly at first, but worth it for slim design that makes it fit better in bag | Came extremely fast and is easily one of the best looking cases for the switch available. Recommend this for anyone looking for a great case! | Phenomenally made, fits perfectly, couldn&#39;t be better. :) | Excellent design, well worth the wait | Really well made! It stores the Switch with the joycons attached. It also has pouches for a few games.\nShipped on time and didn&#39;t have any issue. | Amazing quality! Bit of a wait, but well worth it for such a masterpiece | Great product üëå I love every detail and my switch feels more personalized with this case. | got this as a present for my brother&#39;s birthday and he loved it! | I was in love with this Switch case the moment I opened the package, it&#39;s so well made!! The quality and the design are great and there&#39;s slots for your cartridges too. It&#39;s a great investment and the price is totally justified by how great the whole thing is. I definitely suggest that you check out this shop, they have so many other great stuff too!! I&#39;ll surely buy from them again in the future. | High quality.  Arrived quickly.  Thanks! | Soft on the inside but fabric rough on the outside it&#39;s ok just wouldn&#39;t buy this again. | The case looks and works great. High quality and detail. Very satisfied. | This is fantastic! No kidding, I use mine as a clutch when I&#39;m not using it to carry our Switch. It&#39;s that cute. It&#39;s also incredibly well-made, has plenty of room, and the game card holder provides a nice layer of padding. Love this. Thanks so much!","Buyers consistently praise the case's high quality, craftsmanship, and design, noting it is well-made, sturdy, and often better than expected, with a snug fit and good padding for switch protection; many appreciate the design, secure game storage, and overall aesthetic, particularly for fans, while some mention the tight fit and magnetic clasp alignment as minor issues, and international shipping can take time."

The shirt is not cropped but also not long enough to wear as a regular shirt. The sleeves and back are tighter than the shirt as a whole. The logo is much smaller than shown as well as being see through. There is a reason this product is listed as non-refundable for sure. | This shirt is a completely different cut than the picture and the logo is 1:4 of the size as it is displayed on the model. The shirt looks fitted on the model and the logo is bigger. Definitely a rip off. Also listed as a crop top and is a full length shirt that does not fit like shown in the photo at all very boxy | A wonderful shirt! Came in a timely manner as well | it&#39;s very cute but slightly see though and the design is much smaller than pictured,"The shirt's logo is smaller than pictured, and the shirt is see-through."
